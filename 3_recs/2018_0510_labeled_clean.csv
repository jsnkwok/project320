A few weeks ago I started using the COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, and experienced some stinging/tingling and flushing when using the product. The product unfortunately ended up causing cysts on my chin and forehead (which I usually don't get - especially not ouside of my period), so I stopped using it a few days ago.

I'm trying to figure out which ingredient was the culprit, and made an excel-sheet to cross-check the ingredients. 

(The ingredients are: Salix Alba (Willow Bark Water), Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol)

I'm pretty sure it's not Butylene Glycol, Arginine, Sodium Hyaluronate or Xanthan Gum, since I've used other products with these ingredients, that didn't cause any reaction. I'm also quite convinced that the flushing/tingling I experienced was due to the niacinamide, since that seems to be a common occurence when using the ingredient? Generally, I /think/ the culprit might be the niacinamide, but I don't know if it's common for that ingredient to cause breakouts/cystic acne? I also considered whether the Betaine Salicylate might be responsible, but I've tried products with low concentrations of Salicylic Acid before, and since it works kinda like the Betaine Salicylate (afaik?), that might be enough to rule it out?
 
Any input or experiences with the aforementioned ingredients (especially niacinamide!) would be greatly appreciated, since I don't want to make the mistake of buying other products with an ingredient, that breaks me out. Thank you in advance! :)",4,niacinamide,ingredients,-5

Maybe my experience can help. I have used adapalene for 12 years and was prescribed tretinoin 0.025 gel a couple weeks ago. My t-zone pores are huge and very noticeable. They have been this way for several years and it happened very gradually. They look strange to me. Very ""open"" and dark (not blackheads just a darker/redder color than than the rest of my skin). I have three on my nose that have run together to create one big pore like you describe. My t-zone also has that shiny, over exfoliated look. I have researched every thread I could find relating to this issue. In just about every thread someone mentioned dehydration. I shrugged it off and was sure it was the adapalene had just ruined my pores. How could I be dehydrated? I mean I apply moisturizer like crazy and follow the sca rules. Last week I ordered timeless squalane oil after seeing it recommended so much lately. I have been mixing it with my moisturizer (Hada Labo Tokyo gel), which I apply to my wet face twice a day after showering.

The benton essence isn't a moisturizer. Essence is used to make the face moist so when you add your serums and moisturizers it helps it penetrate the skin better. Please check out the side bar for moisturizer recommendations.

Also, you probably shouldn't use stridex AM and PM. Use it a few times a week even though your skin is accustomed to it. Youre not using moisturizer so your oily-ness could be due to the fact that your skin is dehydrated by all the drying ingredients. Dehydrated skin is when you don't hydrate your skin enough so your skin may start producing more oil to compensate for the lack of hydration. Some ppl get flaky some ppl get oily. 


You should probably also not use a foaming cleanser since its drying and probably won't help your acne. You should get a hydrating cleanser, cerave makes one. More recommendations on the sidebar.


You should stop using all the things that are drying and find a cleanser & moisturizer (and spf) that doesn't irritate your skin first. and then slowly start adding the stridex and BP again. Personally, once i started using a proper moisturizer and started hydrating my skin better, my acne kinda went away on its own. Now i occasionally use generic BP over my moisturizer maybe 2-3 times a week to keep breakouts away. ",6978,bp,ingredients,-4

I'm looking to build a simple routine and am just starting to get my head around the information available here \(rabbit hole, anyone?\). I have a question that seems simple, but I just want to double check. 

I was using Murad Anti\-Aging Time Release Cleanser. The 5&#37; Salicylic Acid was too strong for me, I think because my skin would sometimes burn, and I think it was causing breakouts \(as opposed to just purging\).

I'm a 31\-year\-old female. My skin is normal \(not very oily or dry\), and I used to get pimples only occasion, before the Murad. Generally, I would like my skin to be brighter and a little smoother. I have redness on my cheeks that comes and goes \(sometimes on an hour\-by\-hour basis\), on either cheek or on both. I wonder if it is Rosacea, but there is no broken capillaries or other apparant signs of the condition that I have found. I'm very fair skinned and have always been prone to ""blushing,"" and just always thought this is just how my skin is. 

I think I need to start by just creating a simple routine to get healthy skin before starting to target specific problems. I hear such good things about Cerave and am thinking about trying their Hydrating Facial Cleanser. Here is where my confusion lies: chemical exfoliation. Since this cleanser does not include Salicylic Acid, should I get another product to complement the Cerave to use once or twice a week? In what form should I include that SA, pads like Stridex? Another cleanser containing SA that I use instead of the Cerave once or twice a week? I would prefer a BHA to an AHA in case the redness on my cheeks is actually due to Rosacea, BHAs seem to be preferred in that case.

Right now my routine is really just cleanse once a day, apply facial moisturizer \(containing SPF\) once or twice a day.",2329,salicylic acid,ingredients,0

You’ve got multiple acids, both AHA and BHA. Personally, I wouldn’t use all of those things, since many of them do the same thing, and def. wouldn’t use them all in a single day. 

These are just my thoughts: 

I would use the 30% AHA once per week, at night over your toner after cleansing. IMO this isn’t an every day product, especially when you’re using Differin and all these others acids. 

If you’re concerns are anti aging, I would purchase a proven antioxidant serum. A nice CE Ferulic serum that has been formulated to be effective, and use it at least every other day, applying to skin directly after cleansing. 

Daily SPF. I don’t know if your Cerave has SPF, but def. something that’s necessary for anti aging. 

As far as the Differin, (you mentioned you don’t have acne), last I researched there wasn’t much data available on whether Differin helps with fine lines, wrinkles, pigmentation, etc, - like Tretinoin is proven to do. If you can get your hands on Tretinoin, or an OTC serum with Retinaldehyde, I believe both of those would be better to address your skin concerns. 

These are just my opinions. I don’t go for the ‘everything but the kitchen sink’ routines. I think it’s better to isolate your concerns and find products with proven ingredients to address those exact concerns. Keeping the routine simple makes following it easier for me, and also takes less time. I’m 38, and my routine is strictly anti-aging targeted. It doesn’t have to be difficult or multi-multi-layered in order to be effective. 

Here’s a possible routine for you: 
Morning: Wash. Toner/essence if you feel you need it. HA serum. Active product, good idea would be antioxidant serum. Moisturize/SPF. 

Night: Wash. Toner/essence if you feel you need it. HA serum. Active product. Moisturize. 

You can use a different active each night, rotate them out. Once or twice weekly 30% AHA and your clay mask. 

Here’s an example of my routine, which works amazingly for me and is pretty simple:

Nightly I wash, apply HA serum, and either follow that with Retin a or lotion P50. Moisturizer about an hour later. I use oils. 

Mornings I wash with warm water, apply HA serum and follow it with CE Ferulic serum or Phloretin CF serum. Wait a bit and then apply oils, wait a bit and follow with sunscreen. 

Once a week dermarolling. And that’s it. ",4804,tretinoin,ingredients,-1

You’ve got multiple acids, both AHA and BHA. Personally, I wouldn’t use all of those things, since many of them do the same thing, and def. wouldn’t use them all in a single day. 

These are just my thoughts: 

I would use the 30% AHA once per week, at night over your toner after cleansing. IMO this isn’t an every day product, especially when you’re using Differin and all these others acids. 

If you’re concerns are anti aging, I would purchase a proven antioxidant serum. A nice CE Ferulic serum that has been formulated to be effective, and use it at least every other day, applying to skin directly after cleansing. 

Daily SPF. I don’t know if your Cerave has SPF, but def. something that’s necessary for anti aging. 

As far as the Differin, (you mentioned you don’t have acne), last I researched there wasn’t much data available on whether Differin helps with fine lines, wrinkles, pigmentation, etc, - like Tretinoin is proven to do. If you can get your hands on Tretinoin, or an OTC serum with Retinaldehyde, I believe both of those would be better to address your skin concerns. 

These are just my opinions. I don’t go for the ‘everything but the kitchen sink’ routines. I think it’s better to isolate your concerns and find products with proven ingredients to address those exact concerns. Keeping the routine simple makes following it easier for me, and also takes less time. I’m 38, and my routine is strictly anti-aging targeted. It doesn’t have to be difficult or multi-multi-layered in order to be effective. 

Here’s a possible routine for you: 
Morning: Wash. Toner/essence if you feel you need it. HA serum. Active product, good idea would be antioxidant serum. Moisturize/SPF. 

Night: Wash. Toner/essence if you feel you need it. HA serum. Active product. Moisturize. 

You can use a different active each night, rotate them out. Once or twice weekly 30% AHA and your clay mask.

It protects against photo-aging and cell damage, which can lead to wrinkles. Even in the U.K. daily SPF should be worn and reapplied. 

A well formulated anti-oxidant serum that contains vitamin c, vitamin e, Ferulic Acid, Phloretin, etc can also help protect your skin from free radical damage. Some contain hyaluronic acid to add a little extra hydration. These products can tend to be irritating, also. 

Keeping well hydrated, drinking your recommended daily intake of water helps hydrate you from the inside. 

Retinoids can help build collagen and thicken the the skin, as well as reducing wrinkles. You can choose an OTC product or Rx product, if available to you. However, I would always consult a dermatologist before embarking on retinoid usage, especially if your skin is thin and sensitive. 

I don’t know the ingredients in what you’re currently using, but it could be that something in your products is drying out your skin and causing flakes and possibly wrinkles. Are there actives in your moisturizer? You may want to consider switching up how you do things. Keep your cleansers and moisturizers simple, let them just be gentle cleanserS and effective moisturizers, free of actives. Perhaps your skin could stand to use a richer, more emollient moisturizer. Whe using actives, use serums or other concentrated products that you can choose to apply less often than your daily moisturizer or SPF. 
Consider the actives you’d like to use that target your problems. Research the products and formulations, read reviews before making your choice. 

In my experience, you can keep cleansers and moisturizers cheap. Spend a bit more on your active products, since they will be doing the heavy lifting. Also, since you only need a few drops of a serum, theybladt longer so the money spent isn’t as offensive. ",7690,hyaluronic acid,ingredients,-4

For your texture issues, I would start by focusing on dealing with the dryness that tret can give you. 

For your undereyes, make sure you're getting enough vitamin K in your diet.  Sleep more if you are sleep deprived.  Treat allergies or any other upper respiratory conditions if applicable.

I was desperately searching for an all-mineral sunscreen that was tinted to cover the white cast, but actually dark enough for my skin color. Somebody on here recommended this tinted sunscreen by MDSolarSciences and I’m SO glad I tried it! I requested samples directly from the company and got them within a week or so. It goes on beautifully and is so easy to wear. I don’t wear makeup on top of it and it’s actually pleasant to re-apply because it’s like it’s building coverage. It’s a little fussy in some ways - it clings to some dry patches so you definitely need to use moisturizer underneath it you’re at all dry. It’s also a little weird to apply at first - it’s kinda slippy and it needs to dry down. I’ve never used primer but apparently this has a similar feel. It also has vitamin c, green tea extract and a few other bonus ingredients, though I’m not sure in what quantities. It hasn’t made me flushed or irritated AT ALL and I feel like zinc is actually soothing for me.",92,vitamin c,ingredients,3

I'm giving up on essences, for now. I haven't found one I love after playing around with options from Benton and Tosowoong, and I feel like their benefit is minimal. Even on especially dehydrated days, I can always compensate by using more Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and/or Scinic Honey AIO. I was shopping around for a new one, and was leaning towards Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, but then decided against it. 

**What's In My Stash:**

Oh boy. The stash is very full these days. Before I moved back to the states, I thought I'd be moving to Turkey, and skincare options are very limited there, so I stocked up on some things. Currently sitting in my stash I have:

* Farmacy Honey Potion

* Herbivore True Blue Duo (Lapis Oil and Blue Tansy Mask mini set)

* DE Rise + Glow Duo (C-Firma and B-Hydra Mini Set)

* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream

* Missha FTE Mist

* Etude House Soon Jung Cica Balm

* Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream

* SO MANY SAMPLES

These are all things that are appropriate for my skin types and concerns, because I tried to make this a much more intentional haul than usual. But now that I'm in a place where I can access these products, my stash feels excessively large, especially because I want to move towards a more minimal lifestyle (skincare routine included!) I'm also out of a few ""essentials"" (namely Scinic Honey AIO Ampoule and Stratia Liquid Gold) and really feel kind of bad repurchasing products when there's so much in my stash, even if they're HGs. I also just moved, and am a bit tight on money because of relocation expenses, so that's not helping much.

**Discussion: Samples** 

What do y'all do with samples? I feel like there's not enough product to get a good idea of how it works with your skin, but it also feels wasteful not to use them. Plus, I love trying new products, and theoretically this allows me to do so within a slightly more low-buy framework. But I haven't figured out where to start, and all of my samples are just sitting in a bag on my shelf. So how do you approach using samples?",1023,hada labo,products,-3

I had terrible acne in high school and it took 4 years for my derm to put me on accutane. I wasn't very happy with her for those 4 years. Now being a medical professional, I can totally see why it took her so long. There are also standards of care to consider.

I tested the Timeless Squalene on an irritated patch on my cheek last week and saw some next-day results with less redness! I've had no bad reactions and I've continued using it and the redness is still subsiding. I'm very happy with the results so far in treating irritated skin. 

I've been searching for years for something that would help the irritation on my cheeks, it's only been a few days but I'm very hopeful with the results I've seen so far!

I use tea tree oil to dry out the pimple before it turns into a whitehead, and it helps but it will still turn into one.

Here are my general rules: 

DO: 
• Shower in cold water, making sure to avoid getting any product on the area, including shampoo and conditioner. 

• Use topical burn creams or aloe gel. The topical burn creams can be bought at any drugstore and found in most first aid kits, but the smell is rather strong and I know some who break out from ingredients. Aloe gel isn’t as strong, but it is moisturizing and soothing without overpowering scent. 

• Apply Vaseline/Aquaphor. It won’t moisturize the area, but it keeps whatever moisture you do have in. 

DON’T: 
• Shower in hot water. 

• Any product with alcohol in it, including toners, makeup, face wash etc. The alcohol will dry it out and burn worse than the initial burn. 

• Don’t touch it except when applying treatment. Keep your hair pulled out of your face, and consider putting a bandaid on it at night if you tend to toss and turn

•Pick at any blisters. This looks like a blister might form, and if it does you need to leave it be. Popping it will lengthen the healing process, give the potential of infection, and cause scarring.

The first was in my early twenties. I was going for a mole check, something for my eczema, and something for my acne. 

She judged me for having tattoos and talked down to me. I ended up with a good steroid for my eczema and a diffrin gel (I think I specifically asked for that as I had used my moms and liked it)

The second time was in my late twenties. Also not great. Guy had good bedside manner but was in a rush and not keen to listen to me. Gave me clyndamyacin which did nothing for me and tretonin which I love. He didn’t tell me how to use it. I came back because I got the red dry flakes you get, thinking I was allergic. He very off handedly said “then don’t use it so much” and sent me on my way. No clear explanation on how to build a routing or work up to a tolerance. ",2984,tret,ingredients,7

Been lurking for about a week, reading and learning. I purchased a bunch of new products that should be arriving tomorrow. I know I should introduce them one by one into my routine, but wondering if there’s any order in particular I should introduce them in? How long should I wait between each one? I was thinking a week. 

I have dry skin and hormonal acne on my chin and cheeks. I realized most of what I am using is too drying/stripping

New products:

Jordan Samuel after show cleanser, tarte lactic acid, hado labo hyaluronic acid, drunk elephant c firma, drunk elephant protini, pyunkang yul mist toner, fresh sea berry oil. 

Current routine:

AM
-Clinique take the day off oil cleanser
-pixi glycolic acid 5%
-khiels ultra toner 
-TO vitamin c suspension 
-khiels plumping retexturizing serum
- khiels ultra moisturizer
-TO argan oil
-Clinique tinted spf 50

PM
-Clinique take the day off oil cleanser 
- khiels ultra facial cleanser
- tretonin (every other day)
-khiels ultra toner 
-khiels plumping retexturizing serum
- khiels ultra moisturizer
-TO argan oil 
- UFO (alternating tretonin nights)

I think the WORST is the khiels facewash. I feel very tight/dry/stripped afterwards. Should I do that first and the moisturizer next? It stings when I use the tretonin regularly but I don’t have any abnormal discomfort from the tretonin other than that (dry patches, a little itchy. I don’t get red and scaly anymore). This makes me feel like it’s the alcohol in it which I think is also why it doesn’t feel moisturizing enough, even after attempting to seal it in with an occlusive. 

Thank you.

Also, I have fairly non-sensitive skin which could take anything on including acids of high concentration. 

With that said, the nice effects of tret became immediately visible (within a week or so at the lowest concentration). So absence of irritation does not equate to inefficacy by any means. Just enjoy the fact that you hold a place in a club of lucky few. :)",2517,tret,ingredients,-2

I'm experiencing something weird along these same lines. Started tretinoin 0.025% back in Feb, super slowly increasing the number of days per week of use. Experimented with using it on dry skin and on moisturized dry skin. Had a problem when the non-absorbed tret got moved around everywhere by my hyaluronic acid and moisturizer applied on top and I got super-dry eyelids and some irritation around the mouth.

Around end of March I started getting a weird irritation on the contour of my lips and around them (the area where you normally sweat), but I never put any tret around there. The irritation wasn't improving, so I stopped tret the first week of April, given the fact that I was also leaving for a long pretty active holiday with sun exposure.

The irritation took about 2-3 weeks to completely disappear, I switched to a SLS-free toothpaste, thinking that maybe I became sensitive to SLS because of tret.

I came back from holiday on May 1st, kept using the SLS-free toothpaste, wanted to carefully get back into tret with a low dose applied over moisturized dry skin on Wednesday and Friday evening of last week. And the irritation on and around my lips came back...

Stopped tret again, irritation still going strong. I bought a SLS and fluoride-free toothpaste (that was tough to find) that I'll start using tonight in the hopes it helps... I did this because from my research I arrived to the conclusion that maybe I have some sort of perioral dermatitis?

I'm not sure if I'll have the courage to try tret again, maybe on dried non-moisturized skin in the hopes that it won't transfer somehow... But for now I just want for my skin not to hurt and be irritated. ",3305,hyaluronic acid,ingredients,-6

Then year three came, and my acne became resistant to the antibiotic. My skin flared up the worst I had ever seen it—all over my body too. I continued the Bactrim under awful advice from my derm for another whole year, to no avail. In the meantime, I had developed horrible gastrointestinal problems and tried probiotic therapy for another year after that, which unfortunately, did not get rid of my IBS. I was prescribed accutane by a new derm, despite already having gastrointestinal issues, and it finally cleared my skin. Now because of the antibiotics, I have frequent (and I mean frequent) fungal infections—ringworm, yeast infections, pityrosporum folliculitis, scalp dermatitis, athletes foot, you name it. My bacteria balance in my gut and on my skin is so messed up and I am still trying to heal my body. If I could go back, I would have NEVER taken the antibiotics, especially if I had known it was a temporary solution.

I have enlarged pores. I have combination skin but more on oily side, and I never knew how to deal with this. I get really bad hormonal outbreaks. I started to get the crazy idea in my head that I needed EVERY product that everyone was discussing because they were having these amazing results.

I started using Differin and actives and let me tell you, my face broke out something nasty. The worst cystic acne I have ever had. I was drier than I have ever been. My face was so, so sensitive. I didn't know what to do. I added in face oils. I bought a bunch of different serums. 

Now, a couple weeks after nixing the oils, limiting the serums/treatments, my face adjusting to the Differin/actives, and finding moisturizers that work, I am starting to see real results.

I am convinced that what I am doing is going to lead to great things for my skin down the road and a little pain is worth it for the long term gain. 

What does your current routine look like? If you have a cleanser and a moisturizer that works then stick to those for a while. Let your skin calm down and then evaluate what you're trying to tackle.

You cant tackle everything at once and you do not need every single product just because you see tons of girls/guys on this sub with all the DE and Sunday Riley products possible.

Remember that actives WILL make you purge, even if your skin was on the clear side before. Hormones, stress and diet can contribute to your break outs. It *will* get better.",6179,differin,products,-11

Like you, birth control helped my acne immensely, it’s really the only thing that ever made me feel comfortable leaving my house without makeup. Yasmin gave me COMPLETELY clear skin, but made me have horrendous mood swings and develop melasma. I also gained weight & it was in my stomach so I wasn’t happy about that.

After 8 or 9 months, my family begged me to stop taking Yasmin because I was so angry and lashing out. When I did, my skin was clear for about 6 months afterward. Then, the acne started coming, and coming, and coming... 

I’m still trying to figure out my routine, and it’s been a year total since I stopped the pill. The best thing I’ve found for acne is Paula’s Choice Clear Regular Strength BHA 2% Liquid (from the acne line). I did purge for about 2-3 weeks, but it’s helped my acne quite a bit. Before that, I was using Drunk Elephant products, and then added in Clindamycin gel & Retin A Cream 0.025%. 5 weeks of those topicals gave me the worst cystic acne I have ever had. I stopped using them, and now use that PC Liquid every 3-4 nights. I’ve changed my other products to light layers of hydration instead of a heavy cream. I also started drinking lots of water (I know, I know lol), trying to add in fruits, veggies, and whole grains. Trying to not let stress get to me so much (hard because I have panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder as well as bipolar and OCD). My skin is nowhere near clear, but it has improved. It’s a struggle and PCOS is really hard. For body acne, I swipe some of that BHA liquid on my chest and back all over, and it works well. Make sure to put on SPF always! Wishing you the best from one cyster to another.

TL:DR Try to take the best care you can from the inside out. ",6272,bha,products,4

The 2% Skin Perfecting BHA just has a lower pH (3.2-3.8) so it exfoliates a bit more. I believe it also has some penetration enhancers so it’s a bit more potent. The texture is a bit thicker than the Clear Regular Strength (which is the one I use and it’s texture is basically water). The Regular Strength Clear has a slightly higher pH (3.5-4.0) and is gentler. I would definitely use them at different times. If you’re not sensitive at all, you could do one in the AM & the other PM. Or you could alternate nights. I only use mine about every 3rd night, but my skin is super sensitive, combo-dry, and I have acne. And I hydrate a lot morning and night. It’s helped my acne a lot. Fun fact: the Skin Perfecting Liquid BHA and the EXTRA Strength Clear Liquid BHA (I know you aren’t asking about the latter but I’m throwing it out there anyway) are actually the exact same product, just different packaging!

My skin is extremely sensitive, and it dries me out & irritates my skin if I use it more than 3ish times per week (I have hormonal acne and combo-dry skin for reference). It has really improved my acne (but not completely cleared it). I focus heavily on hydration because my moisture barrier has been damaged for quite awhile. Many people can/do use the BHA nightly.

You can introduce each one slowly. Use one of them once a week for three weeks, twice a week for two weeks, three times a week for a week. See how your skin handles that, and add another one (keep using the first, but add a new one and use it on different days). Repeat this process for each of them. Edit: By doing this, you won't be adding all of them in at once, and if you have a bad reaction to one of the acids, you'll know which one. 

Also, it's incredibly important to use sunscreen in the mornings, and only use acids at night. Acids (and retinol) increase cell turnover and increase your skins sensitivity to the sun.

I’d pick up a kickass vitamin C serum, and use it everywhere including around your eyes. It brightens quickly and is a great general serum. C Firma from Drunk Elephant is nice, and so is the Vitamin C serum from Clinique. If you don’t like an oily texture stick with the Clinique one.

Keep it in the fridge and let the cold bring down some of the puffiness and refresh your eyes then top with the eye cream. But a warning— this will help and is good for your problem, but circles and puffiness are not well treated topically. 

For the fine lines if you want to go in hardcore go right to your doctor and get some tretinoin. You would use it under the other products and it will do more than the retinoids thrown into OTC products. Make sure you use a sunscreen, we can get you some awesome recommendations if you need one.

I’d pick up a kickass vitamin C serum, and use it everywhere including around your eyes. It brightens quickly and is a great general serum. C Firma from Drunk Elephant is nice, and so is the Vitamin C serum from Clinique. If you don’t like an oily texture stick with the Clinique one.

Yes, you can layer everything I just mentioned. 

Moving on from there drink water. Limit stress and get more sleep if you possibly can.

Do you have any other routine besides the eye cream? Something for the rest of your face?",3307,vitamin c,ingredients,16

So heres my story:

I was on Yaz for 4 years. 

Porcelain skin. No enlarged pores. No pimples. Just even, beautiful skin.

When I decided to stop taking it, everything was fine for the first month. The problems started around the middle of month 2. My entire jaw erupted in underground pimples. It was the worst thing I have ever experienced. When I went to wash my face I would get goosebumps every time I touched my cheeks/jawline. But I expected some breakouts (as was warned to me by my doctor) and decided to wait it out. I waited a year and a half for things to get better and they never did. It only got worse. Big, angry, cystic acne that I NEVER experienced up until this point in my life. I tried everything. Eventually my dermatologist told me we had run out of options, and I was left to decide between going back on yaz, or starting accutane.

I chose to go back on yaz. The cystic acne was gone within 3 months. The jawline breakouts took about 8 more months to fully come to a stop. I have been acne free for one year now, and my skin has gone back to it's poreless, porcelain, smooth complexion, but there isnt a day that goes by were I regret starting/going back on birth control. I honestly dont know what im going to do when I start planning for a baby in the near future with my husband. It's a really awful situation to be in... but you should be prepared and have a backup plan. I wish doctors did a better job preparing you for this when initially starting birth control.",6275,accutane,products,-11

beyond that, you should not be washing your face 5\-10 times a day with water, that's only going to dry your skin out. you should not use sunscreen in your PM routine, that should be the last step of your AM routine. in your PM routine you only need one cleanser, pick whichever of your cleansers you like best. your current roster of products seems designed to beat your acne to death by force which is not likely to work. i'd suggest picking out some gentle and/or hydrating products to incorporate into your routine. there are recommendations in the sidebar but one simple swap might be trading the neutrogena moisturizer for something like cerave moisturizing lotion or neutrogena hydro\-boost for extra dry skin.

[Acne] Help! Painful Cystic Chin Acne,2,3,1,8id1fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8id1fj/acne_help_painful_cystic_chin_acne/,bramblebree,"Same here! Hang in there! 

I’ve tried a lot of things, and the following is what heals them the fastest for me (4 days to complete healing vs. 2-3 painful weeks). 

After cleansing, I soak a cotton pad in witch hazel (Thayer’s) and stick it to my chin while I do the rest of my skincare routine for the remainder of my face. Then, I soak another cotton pad in a hyaluronic acid serum or lotion (hadalabo, or milk piggy brand) and stick it to my face while I read or watch tv for about 15 min. I pat dry with another cotton pad and then wear hydrocolloid bandages on top of the growths overnight. If the mountains are especially swollen, I’ll put a thin face towel over my chin (to protect the stickers) and ice my face until I fall asleep.

On weekends I wear the hydrocolloids throughout the day and replace them every few hours, since they keep me from picking and irritating the area further. 

I get mine for $11/3 sheets of 20 on Amazon, and they work pretty much as well as the more expensive CosRX brand. You just have to be more careful about having a completely dry surface before using them to get the same adhesive power out of the generic brand version. I go through a lot of these sheets, but they are the most effective little pus and inflammation warriors ever. 

I do this every night until the swelling goes down. If I’m lucky enough to draw a cyst or two to the surface, I do a warm compress on my chin to ripen them up even more. I put on a clay mask. If I can do a comedone extraction at that point, I will. Then I do the steps I described earlier to keep the swelling at a minimum and draw out all the bacteria.

[skin concerns] Skin is finally hydrated but now I have texture!,8,6,2,8hjz4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hjz4e/skin_concerns_skin_is_finally_hydrated_but_now_i/,bramblebree,"As mentioned above, the Ordinary has great gentle acid treatments that can help gently address that texture you’ve developed. 

I also wonder if a vitamin c serum or low content retinoid might help you. My main concern for texture has been evening out my acne scarring, but I noticed the smaller bumps that I wasn’t so concerned about disappeared as well when I started to use products with retinol in them. 

You’ll want to be careful and start with a less is more approach for retinol. Choose a product with a lower concentration and use it less frequently as you adjust to it. You may want to beef up your moisturizing steps while your skin gets used to it. For a vitamin C serum you may also want to start cautiously, since you’re already dealing with some irritation, but generally you can be a bit more liberal with vitamin c than with a retinoid. I think The Ordinary has some great affordable options for both kinds of products. I’ve also heard good things about Neutrogena’s and RoC’s retinols.

As for toning options, you might enjoy some first treatment essences to get that balancing effect without using an astringent product. The Missha Time Revolution essence and the Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence Rose edition are great for their fermented ingredients. If you’re feeling brave enough to give more cleansing toners a try, Thayer’s Witch Hazel comes in Rose and other scents, and some people react very well to the ingredient. ☺️ Good luck!

Current routine morning and night:
Neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser (foaming formula)
Clean and clear essentials deep cleaning astringent 
Castle and tea tree oil serum

My skin is oily and sensitive. The rest of my face has cleared up for the most part and looks much healthier in general since adding the serum, but my forehead is horrid. I’m trying to cut as much dairy as possible and excess sugar. I drink lots of water.

Questions about what to do next.,4,3,1,8hzezo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hzezo/product_question_allergic_eczema_caused_by/,BurpeesHateMeToo,"I had that reaction to tretinoin .1% when my dermatologist put me on it. The sides of my nose were scabby. It wasn’t fun. Ultimately she put me on Differin instead, and my skin liked that a lot better. To clear up the eczema, she had me using a topical steroid ointment with Aquaphor over the top. It took a while to heal, but thankfully once I stopped using that dosage of tretinoin, it went away. 

Incidentally, I’m now on tretinoin .009% (so less than 10% of the former dose) and it’s fine. No rashes or irritation. I guess the dose before was just too much for my skin to handle. 

I would definitely ask your dermatologist or family doctor about the reaction you’re having. If you’re allergic, you shouldn’t use it again. If you’re just irritated, you might be okay with a much smaller dose or using it less frequently. ",3304,tretinoin,ingredients,5

Untreated or under-treated hypothyroidism can cause cystic acne. I know because it happened to me! I have Hashimoto’s, and before I was diagnosed, my skin became weirdly scaly and dry, but also extremely oily. It defies explanation how skin can both be flaky and oily at the same time, but there you have it. Anyway, even though I’d been on Accutane ten years before and had had spectacular results with it, I started having cystic acne. (And of course I had a ton of other horrible symptoms as well... unexplained weight gain, daily migraines, felt cold and sluggish all the time, I had my period for 6 months straight and it was like a freaking tidal wave the entire time, etc.)

Anyway, fast forward, finally I saw a doctor who figured it out and put me on Levothyroxine, which helped with some of my symptoms, but I still felt horrible and my skin wasn’t totally better. He added Cytomel, and that solved my problems totally. I guess my body doesn’t effectively convert T4 into T3, which can cause a lot of secondary symptoms. ",5134,accutane,products,-10

I tried TO Lactic Acid 5% for the first time about a month ago and I used it for around 3 weeks alternating it on different nights with differin. I began to notice my skin was strangely shiny, I was breaking out a lot, and it felt irritated, so I stopped because I assumed I was overexfoliating. I have sensitive/dry skin, so could it be possible that using an AHA AND differin in the same routine is just too much for my skin? Also, I'm looking to control the mild acne I have and get smoother/glowier skin. Would an AHA potentially benefit me more than the differin, or should I just continue using differin and drop the AHA? Also, is it okay to use Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in the morning and retinoid at night, or is that likely going to irritate me? I've been using it as a spot treatment and I don't want to hurt my skin. My routine is a mess...help is greatly appreciated!!

Current routine:

AM: rinse, moisturize with neutrogena sensitive skin, australian gold tinted botanicals sunscreen

PM: remove sunscreen with garnier micellar water, cleanse with neutrogena ultra gentle creamy formula, differin, moisturize, aquaphor

Wash: if no occlusive the night before, no wash, I just use a really gentle microfiber wash cloth to GENTLY wipe down my skin and then splash a bit. If I used an occlusive, I’ll either use Simple Micellar or Vanicream foaming cleanser.
Moisture: Squalane oil, TO or Timeless brand. I apply once, while my face is wet from washing/splashing, then another layer a few minutes later 
Protect: spf 30, no specific brand cuz I’m currently brand-hopping to find one I will keep using! I have had more luck with physical SPF than chemical when dealing with sensitive skin- usually less burn-y

If I wore makeup: gently loosen makeup with wet microfiber cloth. I try to avoid wearing a ton of makeup when my skin is in hell though, as it can be really irritating for me. 
Vanicream foaming cleanser
Squalane
Vaseline or aquaphor on top

**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG status. I like my oil cleansers thick, and DHC is thicc. Not a huge fan of the straight up olive oil scent, but it wouldn’t keep me from repurchasing.

**Farmacy Clear Bloom Makeup Glideaway Cleansing Oil - WNRP  - 🐌🐌🐌**
A solid choice for an oil cleanser. Thinner than DHC, but still feels elegant. Would not repurchase because it’s on the pricey side, but I will enjoy it while I have it. 

**Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash - WNRP - 🐌**
Not impressed. It’s ever so slightly drying. The antibac soap smell bothers me. 

**Kiku High Moist - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great and it’s cheap. But I don’t know if it does anything other toners can’t do. I will probably take a break if I ever manage to finish this bottle. 

**Swanicoco AC Free Control Care Skintoner with Tea Tree Water - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Almost runnier than water if that’s possible? Nothing special.

**Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. It smells like a cuppa Earl Grey, and I am in love. 

**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Need I say more?

**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
My skin is tough as nails, and I don’t know if this is enough for me. I’m currently mixing it with TO LAA Powder. 

**The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. The purge is real with this one, but once it’s over, magic.

**Boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Recently purchased, but loving it so far. Smells like roses and very hydrating. Almost as good as Sulwhasoo Overnight Mask, not quite, but almost.

**Mizon Snail All-in-One Gel Cream - Probably WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I highly recommend it. But I’m still unclear if Mizon is shutting down? Probably won’t look into repurchasing for that. 

**Belif Aqua Bomb - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Perfect summer gel moisturizer. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Pure Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
The entire line has been rebranded. I love the old packaging / hate the new packaging so I don’t know if I’ll repurchase, but I love this cream. It’s thicc and melts down completely matte. 

I’ve sampled DE Lala Retro and find this to be a very respectable dupe. 

**Rosette Ceramide Gel - Probably WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
If it’s not obvious, I’ve got quite a few moisturizers. I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase or try something new, but I love this moisturizer for what it’s worth. It’s the main reason I got through the differin purge relatively unscathed. I have no issues with it not sinking in / staying sticky like some report. It dries down, is super calming, and doesn’t break me out like the Dr. Jart Ceramidin line. 

**Botanic Farm Black Soybean Milk Pudding Sleeping Pack - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
It’s good, but I’m not in love. Not a fan of the pudding/gel texture and scent. It doesn’t dry down and stays sticky.

**Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I would recommend it. But the main selling point is the niacinamide, which I already use. Dries down, doesn’t stay sticky, nice texture. 

**Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This oil gives me serious Glow. It’s almost like a dry oil, but not quite. Sinks in very well and has a pleasant, light scent. 

**Manuka Doctor Brightening Facial Oil - WNRP - 🐌**
Smells like old lady perfume. I never reach for it because I hate the smell so much. It’s not a cuticle oil.

**The Ordinary Borage Seed Oil - WRNP - 🐌🐌**
It’s pretty good. I purchased it because it’s cheap and supposedly high in linoleic acid. I still prefer rosehip seed oil and will go back to that once I’m done with this. Now a cuticle oil as well. 

**The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
I’m on the fence if this is truly amazing or not.. I apply it at night, and I think my skin is glowier in the morning? This is my second bottle, and I have some thinking to do if it’s worth a third repurchase. 

**The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Did I mention my skin is nuclear-proof? My first bottle, I used it according to directions and wasn’t terribly impressed. Decided to give it another go instead of blowing $$$$ on Drunk Elephant. I ~accidentally~ left it on for 30 minutes when I got sucked down an online shopping hole. And, holy moly was my skin baby soft. Roast me. 

**Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
A standard mess-proof clay mask. Nothing really ~mousse~ about it, only that it comes in a can. 

**Farmacy Honey Potion Mask - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Honestly, I mostly like it for the warming sensation. I don’t know if it does anything special for my face. It’s a nice weekend splurge. 

**Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding Intensive Wash-Off Treatment - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Another standard clay mask. This was actually a giant sample. It’s good, but the full-size is pricey, and it doesn’t do anything special to justify the price. 



**Wall Shelf**



**The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG HG HG. This seems to be a controversial product, but I am in love. It’s finely milled and inexpensive. I’ve never had great luck with any vitamin c product, but this has provided Results. I mix it with an aha/bha, and my skin is Glowing. 

**Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This cream gets me through the winter. So thicc, and I love the camphor scent. On my second jar. 

**Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
On the shelf because the bottle is pretty. I’ll occasionally mix a miniscule amount in with a toner or essence if my skin is acting up. 

**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. What PIH? It helps more with active spots to keep them from scarring. I haven’t seen much improvement from older marks with this alone. 

**Hylamide Glow Booster - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌** 
It makes me look alive / not a vampire / not orange.

**Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
New addition. Loving it so far, feels incredibly elegant and sinks in well. But slightly worried about all the essential oils and strong fragrance. 

**Sunday Riley UFO Oil - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Managed to snag this for $30. There is no way it’s worth full price. It’s nice but does absolutely nothing more than a reasonably priced oil does.

**Sunday Riley Good Genes - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. It’s nice, but I have so many other products that give me The Glow, I don’t notice any difference using this. Definitely not worth the $$$$ or the hype.

**Curology - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
1st month - 0.009% tret, 1% clindamycin, 9% aza
2nd month - 0.018% tret, 1% clindamycin, 8% aza

Switched to this after giving otc differin a try. I was still getting too much acne with differin, and it’s already been drastically reduced with one month of Curology. Acne scars have also faded crazy fast. 

**Biore Smooth UV Perfect Light Milk (Pink bottle) - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Pretty good, but not for me. No white cast, but sort of feels like it slides off my face. 

**Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. No need to beat a dead horse.



**Samples**



**Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass - WP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Takes some of the redness away, dries down nicely. Will purchase in the fall.

**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream - On The Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Will consider purchasing when the weather turns cold again, but maybe not depending on how many creams I have left. 

**Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, extremely elegant gel, but I don’t believe in spending $$$ for eye creams.

**Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, thicker eye cream. But see above.

**Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Okay, not as great as the other two, but see above. 

**Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Like a less cosmetically elegant Belif Aqua Bomb + birch smells. Kind of a lumpy, watery gel imo. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Face Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Same as the other Roebuck cream. Not a fan of the new packaging. The ingredients in this Face cream are more attractive, but I prefer the texture and application of the Pure cream. This one is just average. 

**Eclado Cell Memory Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. Not bad, but nothing special. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Pink Juice Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌**
Extremely lightweight moisturizer. It’s nice, and I like the jolly rancher scent, but I think I need a thicker product. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask (recently finished) - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
I wanted to love this, but I couldn’t get it to not pill. It pilled so bad, it would flake into my hair overnight. I did glob it on, so I might purchase a full size and try a thinner layer + some rosehip seed oil. The jolly rancher smell is almost overpowering, but I enjoyed it.

**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG status. I like my oil cleansers thick, and DHC is thicc. Not a huge fan of the straight up olive oil scent, but it wouldn’t keep me from repurchasing.

**Farmacy Clear Bloom Makeup Glideaway Cleansing Oil - WNRP  - 🐌🐌🐌**
A solid choice for an oil cleanser. Thinner than DHC, but still feels elegant. Would not repurchase because it’s on the pricey side, but I will enjoy it while I have it. 

**Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash - WNRP - 🐌**
Not impressed. It’s ever so slightly drying. The antibac soap smell bothers me. 

**Kiku High Moist - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great and it’s cheap. But I don’t know if it does anything other toners can’t do. I will probably take a break if I ever manage to finish this bottle. 

**Swanicoco AC Free Control Care Skintoner with Tea Tree Water - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Almost runnier than water if that’s possible? Nothing special.

**Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. It smells like a cuppa Earl Grey, and I am in love. 

**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Need I say more?

**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
My skin is tough as nails, and I don’t know if this is enough for me. I’m currently mixing it with TO LAA Powder. 

**The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. The purge is real with this one, but once it’s over, magic.

**Boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Recently purchased, but loving it so far. Smells like roses and very hydrating. Almost as good as Sulwhasoo Overnight Mask, not quite, but almost.

**Mizon Snail All-in-One Gel Cream - Probably WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I highly recommend it. But I’m still unclear if Mizon is shutting down? Probably won’t look into repurchasing for that. 

**Belif Aqua Bomb - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Perfect summer gel moisturizer. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Pure Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
The entire line has been rebranded. I love the old packaging / hate the new packaging so I don’t know if I’ll repurchase, but I love this cream. It’s thicc and melts down completely matte. 

I’ve sampled DE Lala Retro and find this to be a very respectable dupe. 

**Rosette Ceramide Gel - Probably WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
If it’s not obvious, I’ve got quite a few moisturizers. I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase or try something new, but I love this moisturizer for what it’s worth. It’s the main reason I got through the differin purge relatively unscathed. I have no issues with it not sinking in / staying sticky like some report. It dries down, is super calming, and doesn’t break me out like the Dr. Jart Ceramidin line. 

**Botanic Farm Black Soybean Milk Pudding Sleeping Pack - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
It’s good, but I’m not in love. Not a fan of the pudding/gel texture and scent. It doesn’t dry down and stays sticky.

**Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I would recommend it. But the main selling point is the niacinamide, which I already use. Dries down, doesn’t stay sticky, nice texture. 

**Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This oil gives me serious Glow. It’s almost like a dry oil, but not quite. Sinks in very well and has a pleasant, light scent. 

**Manuka Doctor Brightening Facial Oil - WNRP - 🐌**
Smells like old lady perfume. I never reach for it because I hate the smell so much. It’s not a cuticle oil.

**The Ordinary Borage Seed Oil - WRNP - 🐌🐌**
It’s pretty good. I purchased it because it’s cheap and supposedly high in linoleic acid. I still prefer rosehip seed oil and will go back to that once I’m done with this. Now a cuticle oil as well. 

**The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
I’m on the fence if this is truly amazing or not.. I apply it at night, and I think my skin is glowier in the morning? This is my second bottle, and I have some thinking to do if it’s worth a third repurchase. 

**The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Did I mention my skin is nuclear-proof? My first bottle, I used it according to directions and wasn’t terribly impressed. Decided to give it another go instead of blowing $$$$ on Drunk Elephant. I ~accidentally~ left it on for 30 minutes when I got sucked down an online shopping hole. And, holy moly was my skin baby soft. Roast me. 

**Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
A standard mess-proof clay mask. Nothing really ~mousse~ about it, only that it comes in a can. 

**Farmacy Honey Potion Mask - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Honestly, I mostly like it for the warming sensation. I don’t know if it does anything special for my face. It’s a nice weekend splurge. 

**Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding Intensive Wash-Off Treatment - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Another standard clay mask. This was actually a giant sample. It’s good, but the full-size is pricey, and it doesn’t do anything special to justify the price. 



**Wall Shelf**



**The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG HG HG. This seems to be a controversial product, but I am in love. It’s finely milled and inexpensive. I’ve never had great luck with any vitamin c product, but this has provided Results. I mix it with an aha/bha, and my skin is Glowing. 

**Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This cream gets me through the winter. So thicc, and I love the camphor scent. On my second jar. 

**Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
On the shelf because the bottle is pretty. I’ll occasionally mix a miniscule amount in with a toner or essence if my skin is acting up. 

**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. What PIH? It helps more with active spots to keep them from scarring. I haven’t seen much improvement from older marks with this alone. 

**Hylamide Glow Booster - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌** 
It makes me look alive / not a vampire / not orange.

**Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
New addition. Loving it so far, feels incredibly elegant and sinks in well. But slightly worried about all the essential oils and strong fragrance. 

**Sunday Riley UFO Oil - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Managed to snag this for $30. There is no way it’s worth full price. It’s nice but does absolutely nothing more than a reasonably priced oil does.

**Sunday Riley Good Genes - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. It’s nice, but I have so many other products that give me The Glow, I don’t notice any difference using this. Definitely not worth the $$$$ or the hype.

**Curology - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
1st month - 0.009% tret, 1% clindamycin, 9% aza
2nd month - 0.018% tret, 1% clindamycin, 8% aza

Switched to this after giving otc differin a try. I was still getting too much acne with differin, and it’s already been drastically reduced with one month of Curology. Acne scars have also faded crazy fast. 

**Biore Smooth UV Perfect Light Milk (Pink bottle) - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Pretty good, but not for me. No white cast, but sort of feels like it slides off my face. 

**Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. No need to beat a dead horse.



**Samples**



**Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass - WP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Takes some of the redness away, dries down nicely. Will purchase in the fall.

**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream - On The Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Will consider purchasing when the weather turns cold again, but maybe not depending on how many creams I have left. 

**Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, extremely elegant gel, but I don’t believe in spending $$$ for eye creams.

**Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, thicker eye cream. But see above.

**Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Okay, not as great as the other two, but see above. 

**Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Like a less cosmetically elegant Belif Aqua Bomb + birch smells. Kind of a lumpy, watery gel imo. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Face Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Same as the other Roebuck cream. Not a fan of the new packaging. The ingredients in this Face cream are more attractive, but I prefer the texture and application of the Pure cream. This one is just average. 

**Eclado Cell Memory Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. Not bad, but nothing special. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Pink Juice Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌**
Extremely lightweight moisturizer. It’s nice, and I like the jolly rancher scent, but I think I need a thicker product.

**Dr. Roebuck’s Face Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Same as the other Roebuck cream. Not a fan of the new packaging. The ingredients in this Face cream are more attractive, but I prefer the texture and application of the Pure cream. This one is just average. 

**Eclado Cell Memory Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. Not bad, but nothing special. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Pink Juice Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌**
Extremely lightweight moisturizer. It’s nice, and I like the jolly rancher scent, but I think I need a thicker product. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask (recently finished) - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
I wanted to love this, but I couldn’t get it to not pill. It pilled so bad, it would flake into my hair overnight. I did glob it on, so I might purchase a full size and try a thinner layer + some rosehip seed oil. The jolly rancher smell is almost overpowering, but I enjoyed it.

**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG status. I like my oil cleansers thick, and DHC is thicc. Not a huge fan of the straight up olive oil scent, but it wouldn’t keep me from repurchasing.

**Farmacy Clear Bloom Makeup Glideaway Cleansing Oil - WNRP  - 🐌🐌🐌**
A solid choice for an oil cleanser. Thinner than DHC, but still feels elegant. Would not repurchase because it’s on the pricey side, but I will enjoy it while I have it. 

**Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash - WNRP - 🐌**
Not impressed. It’s ever so slightly drying. The antibac soap smell bothers me. 

**Kiku High Moist - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great and it’s cheap. But I don’t know if it does anything other toners can’t do. I will probably take a break if I ever manage to finish this bottle. 

**Swanicoco AC Free Control Care Skintoner with Tea Tree Water - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Almost runnier than water if that’s possible? Nothing special.

**Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. It smells like a cuppa Earl Grey, and I am in love. 

**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Need I say more?

**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
My skin is tough as nails, and I don’t know if this is enough for me. I’m currently mixing it with TO LAA Powder. 

**The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. The purge is real with this one, but once it’s over, magic.

**Boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Recently purchased, but loving it so far. Smells like roses and very hydrating. Almost as good as Sulwhasoo Overnight Mask, not quite, but almost.

**Mizon Snail All-in-One Gel Cream - Probably WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I highly recommend it. But I’m still unclear if Mizon is shutting down? Probably won’t look into repurchasing for that. 

**Belif Aqua Bomb - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Perfect summer gel moisturizer. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Pure Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
The entire line has been rebranded. I love the old packaging / hate the new packaging so I don’t know if I’ll repurchase, but I love this cream. It’s thicc and melts down completely matte. 

I’ve sampled DE Lala Retro and find this to be a very respectable dupe. 

**Rosette Ceramide Gel - Probably WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
If it’s not obvious, I’ve got quite a few moisturizers. I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase or try something new, but I love this moisturizer for what it’s worth. It’s the main reason I got through the differin purge relatively unscathed. I have no issues with it not sinking in / staying sticky like some report. It dries down, is super calming, and doesn’t break me out like the Dr. Jart Ceramidin line. 

**Botanic Farm Black Soybean Milk Pudding Sleeping Pack - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
It’s good, but I’m not in love. Not a fan of the pudding/gel texture and scent. It doesn’t dry down and stays sticky.

**Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I would recommend it. But the main selling point is the niacinamide, which I already use. Dries down, doesn’t stay sticky, nice texture. 

**Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This oil gives me serious Glow. It’s almost like a dry oil, but not quite. Sinks in very well and has a pleasant, light scent. 

**Manuka Doctor Brightening Facial Oil - WNRP - 🐌**
Smells like old lady perfume. I never reach for it because I hate the smell so much. It’s not a cuticle oil.

**The Ordinary Borage Seed Oil - WRNP - 🐌🐌**
It’s pretty good. I purchased it because it’s cheap and supposedly high in linoleic acid. I still prefer rosehip seed oil and will go back to that once I’m done with this. Now a cuticle oil as well. 

**The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
I’m on the fence if this is truly amazing or not.. I apply it at night, and I think my skin is glowier in the morning? This is my second bottle, and I have some thinking to do if it’s worth a third repurchase. 

**The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Did I mention my skin is nuclear-proof? My first bottle, I used it according to directions and wasn’t terribly impressed. Decided to give it another go instead of blowing $$$$ on Drunk Elephant. I ~accidentally~ left it on for 30 minutes when I got sucked down an online shopping hole. And, holy moly was my skin baby soft. Roast me. 

**Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
A standard mess-proof clay mask. Nothing really ~mousse~ about it, only that it comes in a can. 

**Farmacy Honey Potion Mask - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Honestly, I mostly like it for the warming sensation. I don’t know if it does anything special for my face. It’s a nice weekend splurge. 

**Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding Intensive Wash-Off Treatment - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Another standard clay mask. This was actually a giant sample. It’s good, but the full-size is pricey, and it doesn’t do anything special to justify the price. 



**Wall Shelf**



**The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG HG HG. This seems to be a controversial product, but I am in love. It’s finely milled and inexpensive. I’ve never had great luck with any vitamin c product, but this has provided Results. I mix it with an aha/bha, and my skin is Glowing. 

**Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This cream gets me through the winter. So thicc, and I love the camphor scent. On my second jar. 

**Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
On the shelf because the bottle is pretty. I’ll occasionally mix a miniscule amount in with a toner or essence if my skin is acting up. 

**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. What PIH? It helps more with active spots to keep them from scarring. I haven’t seen much improvement from older marks with this alone. 

**Hylamide Glow Booster - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌** 
It makes me look alive / not a vampire / not orange.

**Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
New addition. Loving it so far, feels incredibly elegant and sinks in well. But slightly worried about all the essential oils and strong fragrance. 

**Sunday Riley UFO Oil - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Managed to snag this for $30. There is no way it’s worth full price. It’s nice but does absolutely nothing more than a reasonably priced oil does.

**Sunday Riley Good Genes - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. It’s nice, but I have so many other products that give me The Glow, I don’t notice any difference using this. Definitely not worth the $$$$ or the hype.

**Curology - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
1st month - 0.009% tret, 1% clindamycin, 9% aza
2nd month - 0.018% tret, 1% clindamycin, 8% aza

Switched to this after giving otc differin a try. I was still getting too much acne with differin, and it’s already been drastically reduced with one month of Curology. Acne scars have also faded crazy fast. 

**Biore Smooth UV Perfect Light Milk (Pink bottle) - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Pretty good, but not for me. No white cast, but sort of feels like it slides off my face. 

**Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. No need to beat a dead horse.



**Samples**



**Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass - WP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Takes some of the redness away, dries down nicely. Will purchase in the fall.

**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream - On The Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Will consider purchasing when the weather turns cold again, but maybe not depending on how many creams I have left. 

**Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, extremely elegant gel, but I don’t believe in spending $$$ for eye creams.

**Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, thicker eye cream. But see above.

**Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌**

Great. Will consider purchasing when the weather turns cold again, but maybe not depending on how many creams I have left. 

**Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, extremely elegant gel, but I don’t believe in spending $$$ for eye creams.

**Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, thicker eye cream. But see above.

**Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Okay, not as great as the other two, but see above. 

**Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Like a less cosmetically elegant Belif Aqua Bomb + birch smells. Kind of a lumpy, watery gel imo. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Face Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Same as the other Roebuck cream. Not a fan of the new packaging. The ingredients in this Face cream are more attractive, but I prefer the texture and application of the Pure cream. This one is just average. 

**Eclado Cell Memory Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. Not bad, but nothing special. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Pink Juice Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌**
Extremely lightweight moisturizer. It’s nice, and I like the jolly rancher scent, but I think I need a thicker product. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask (recently finished) - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
I wanted to love this, but I couldn’t get it to not pill. It pilled so bad, it would flake into my hair overnight. I did glob it on, so I might purchase a full size and try a thinner layer + some rosehip seed oil. The jolly rancher smell is almost overpowering, but I enjoyed it.

**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG status. I like my oil cleansers thick, and DHC is thicc. Not a huge fan of the straight up olive oil scent, but it wouldn’t keep me from repurchasing.

**Farmacy Clear Bloom Makeup Glideaway Cleansing Oil - WNRP  - 🐌🐌🐌**
A solid choice for an oil cleanser. Thinner than DHC, but still feels elegant. Would not repurchase because it’s on the pricey side, but I will enjoy it while I have it. 

**Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash - WNRP - 🐌**
Not impressed. It’s ever so slightly drying. The antibac soap smell bothers me. 

**Kiku High Moist - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great and it’s cheap. But I don’t know if it does anything other toners can’t do. I will probably take a break if I ever manage to finish this bottle. 

**Swanicoco AC Free Control Care Skintoner with Tea Tree Water - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Almost runnier than water if that’s possible? Nothing special.

**Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. It smells like a cuppa Earl Grey, and I am in love. 

**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Need I say more?

**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
My skin is tough as nails, and I don’t know if this is enough for me. I’m currently mixing it with TO LAA Powder. 

**The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. The purge is real with this one, but once it’s over, magic.

**Boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Recently purchased, but loving it so far. Smells like roses and very hydrating. Almost as good as Sulwhasoo Overnight Mask, not quite, but almost.

**Mizon Snail All-in-One Gel Cream - Probably WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I highly recommend it. But I’m still unclear if Mizon is shutting down? Probably won’t look into repurchasing for that. 

**Belif Aqua Bomb - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Perfect summer gel moisturizer. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Pure Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
The entire line has been rebranded. I love the old packaging / hate the new packaging so I don’t know if I’ll repurchase, but I love this cream. It’s thicc and melts down completely matte. 

I’ve sampled DE Lala Retro and find this to be a very respectable dupe. 

**Rosette Ceramide Gel - Probably WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
If it’s not obvious, I’ve got quite a few moisturizers. I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase or try something new, but I love this moisturizer for what it’s worth. It’s the main reason I got through the differin purge relatively unscathed. I have no issues with it not sinking in / staying sticky like some report. It dries down, is super calming, and doesn’t break me out like the Dr. Jart Ceramidin line. 

**Botanic Farm Black Soybean Milk Pudding Sleeping Pack - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
It’s good, but I’m not in love. Not a fan of the pudding/gel texture and scent. It doesn’t dry down and stays sticky.

**Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I would recommend it. But the main selling point is the niacinamide, which I already use. Dries down, doesn’t stay sticky, nice texture. 

**Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This oil gives me serious Glow. It’s almost like a dry oil, but not quite. Sinks in very well and has a pleasant, light scent. 

**Manuka Doctor Brightening Facial Oil - WNRP - 🐌**
Smells like old lady perfume. I never reach for it because I hate the smell so much. It’s not a cuticle oil.

**The Ordinary Borage Seed Oil - WRNP - 🐌🐌**
It’s pretty good. I purchased it because it’s cheap and supposedly high in linoleic acid. I still prefer rosehip seed oil and will go back to that once I’m done with this. Now a cuticle oil as well. 

**The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
I’m on the fence if this is truly amazing or not.. I apply it at night, and I think my skin is glowier in the morning? This is my second bottle, and I have some thinking to do if it’s worth a third repurchase. 

**The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Did I mention my skin is nuclear-proof? My first bottle, I used it according to directions and wasn’t terribly impressed. Decided to give it another go instead of blowing $$$$ on Drunk Elephant. I ~accidentally~ left it on for 30 minutes when I got sucked down an online shopping hole. And, holy moly was my skin baby soft. Roast me. 

**Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
A standard mess-proof clay mask. Nothing really ~mousse~ about it, only that it comes in a can. 

**Farmacy Honey Potion Mask - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Honestly, I mostly like it for the warming sensation. I don’t know if it does anything special for my face. It’s a nice weekend splurge. 

**Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding Intensive Wash-Off Treatment - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Another standard clay mask. This was actually a giant sample. It’s good, but the full-size is pricey, and it doesn’t do anything special to justify the price. 



**Wall Shelf**



**The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG HG HG. This seems to be a controversial product, but I am in love. It’s finely milled and inexpensive. I’ve never had great luck with any vitamin c product, but this has provided Results. I mix it with an aha/bha, and my skin is Glowing. 

**Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This cream gets me through the winter. So thicc, and I love the camphor scent. On my second jar. 

**Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
On the shelf because the bottle is pretty. I’ll occasionally mix a miniscule amount in with a toner or essence if my skin is acting up. 

**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. What PIH? It helps more with active spots to keep them from scarring. I haven’t seen much improvement from older marks with this alone. 

**Hylamide Glow Booster - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌** 
It makes me look alive / not a vampire / not orange.

**Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
New addition. Loving it so far, feels incredibly elegant and sinks in well. But slightly worried about all the essential oils and strong fragrance. 

**Sunday Riley UFO Oil - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Managed to snag this for $30. There is no way it’s worth full price. It’s nice but does absolutely nothing more than a reasonably priced oil does.

**Sunday Riley Good Genes - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. It’s nice, but I have so many other products that give me The Glow, I don’t notice any difference using this. Definitely not worth the $$$$ or the hype.

**Curology - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
1st month - 0.009% tret, 1% clindamycin, 9% aza
2nd month - 0.018% tret, 1% clindamycin, 8% aza

Switched to this after giving otc differin a try. I was still getting too much acne with differin, and it’s already been drastically reduced with one month of Curology. Acne scars have also faded crazy fast. 

**Biore Smooth UV Perfect Light Milk (Pink bottle) - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Pretty good, but not for me. No white cast, but sort of feels like it slides off my face. 

**Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. No need to beat a dead horse.

Switched to this after giving otc differin a try. I was still getting too much acne with differin, and it’s already been drastically reduced with one month of Curology. Acne scars have also faded crazy fast. 

**Biore Smooth UV Perfect Light Milk (Pink bottle) - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Pretty good, but not for me. No white cast, but sort of feels like it slides off my face. 

**Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. No need to beat a dead horse.



**Samples**



**Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass - WP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Takes some of the redness away, dries down nicely. Will purchase in the fall.

**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream - On The Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Great. Will consider purchasing when the weather turns cold again, but maybe not depending on how many creams I have left. 

**Belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, extremely elegant gel, but I don’t believe in spending $$$ for eye creams.

**Drunk Elephant C-Tango Multivitamin Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Nice, thicker eye cream. But see above.

**Origins GinZing Refreshing Eye Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Okay, not as great as the other two, but see above. 

**Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Like a less cosmetically elegant Belif Aqua Bomb + birch smells. Kind of a lumpy, watery gel imo. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Face Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
Same as the other Roebuck cream. Not a fan of the new packaging. The ingredients in this Face cream are more attractive, but I prefer the texture and application of the Pure cream. This one is just average. 

**Eclado Cell Memory Cream - WNP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. Not bad, but nothing special. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Pink Juice Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌**
Extremely lightweight moisturizer. It’s nice, and I like the jolly rancher scent, but I think I need a thicker product. 

**Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask (recently finished) - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
I wanted to love this, but I couldn’t get it to not pill. It pilled so bad, it would flake into my hair overnight. I did glob it on, so I might purchase a full size and try a thinner layer + some rosehip seed oil. The jolly rancher smell is almost overpowering, but I enjoyed it.

**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG status. I like my oil cleansers thick, and DHC is thicc. Not a huge fan of the straight up olive oil scent, but it wouldn’t keep me from repurchasing.

**Farmacy Clear Bloom Makeup Glideaway Cleansing Oil - WNRP  - 🐌🐌🐌**
A solid choice for an oil cleanser. Thinner than DHC, but still feels elegant. Would not repurchase because it’s on the pricey side, but I will enjoy it while I have it. 

**Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash - WNRP - 🐌**
Not impressed. It’s ever so slightly drying. The antibac soap smell bothers me. 

**Kiku High Moist - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great and it’s cheap. But I don’t know if it does anything other toners can’t do. I will probably take a break if I ever manage to finish this bottle. 

**Swanicoco AC Free Control Care Skintoner with Tea Tree Water - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Almost runnier than water if that’s possible? Nothing special.

**Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. It smells like a cuppa Earl Grey, and I am in love. 

**Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Need I say more?

**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌**
My skin is tough as nails, and I don’t know if this is enough for me. I’m currently mixing it with TO LAA Powder. 

**The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. The purge is real with this one, but once it’s over, magic.

**Boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
Recently purchased, but loving it so far. Smells like roses and very hydrating. Almost as good as Sulwhasoo Overnight Mask, not quite, but almost.

**Mizon Snail All-in-One Gel Cream - Probably WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I highly recommend it. But I’m still unclear if Mizon is shutting down? Probably won’t look into repurchasing for that. 

**Belif Aqua Bomb - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Perfect summer gel moisturizer. 

**Dr. Roebuck’s Pure Hydrating Moisturizer - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
The entire line has been rebranded. I love the old packaging / hate the new packaging so I don’t know if I’ll repurchase, but I love this cream. It’s thicc and melts down completely matte. 

I’ve sampled DE Lala Retro and find this to be a very respectable dupe. 

**Rosette Ceramide Gel - Probably WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
If it’s not obvious, I’ve got quite a few moisturizers. I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase or try something new, but I love this moisturizer for what it’s worth. It’s the main reason I got through the differin purge relatively unscathed. I have no issues with it not sinking in / staying sticky like some report. It dries down, is super calming, and doesn’t break me out like the Dr. Jart Ceramidin line. 

**Botanic Farm Black Soybean Milk Pudding Sleeping Pack - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
It’s good, but I’m not in love. Not a fan of the pudding/gel texture and scent. It doesn’t dry down and stays sticky.

**Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
It’s great, and I would recommend it. But the main selling point is the niacinamide, which I already use. Dries down, doesn’t stay sticky, nice texture. 

**Youth to the People Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This oil gives me serious Glow. It’s almost like a dry oil, but not quite. Sinks in very well and has a pleasant, light scent. 

**Manuka Doctor Brightening Facial Oil - WNRP - 🐌**
Smells like old lady perfume. I never reach for it because I hate the smell so much. It’s not a cuticle oil.

**The Ordinary Borage Seed Oil - WRNP - 🐌🐌**
It’s pretty good. I purchased it because it’s cheap and supposedly high in linoleic acid. I still prefer rosehip seed oil and will go back to that once I’m done with this. Now a cuticle oil as well. 

**The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
I’m on the fence if this is truly amazing or not.. I apply it at night, and I think my skin is glowier in the morning? This is my second bottle, and I have some thinking to do if it’s worth a third repurchase. 

**The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Did I mention my skin is nuclear-proof? My first bottle, I used it according to directions and wasn’t terribly impressed. Decided to give it another go instead of blowing $$$$ on Drunk Elephant. I ~accidentally~ left it on for 30 minutes when I got sucked down an online shopping hole. And, holy moly was my skin baby soft. Roast me. 

**Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
A standard mess-proof clay mask. Nothing really ~mousse~ about it, only that it comes in a can. 

**Farmacy Honey Potion Mask - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. Honestly, I mostly like it for the warming sensation. I don’t know if it does anything special for my face. It’s a nice weekend splurge. 

**Boscia Charcoal Pore Pudding Intensive Wash-Off Treatment - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Another standard clay mask. This was actually a giant sample. It’s good, but the full-size is pricey, and it doesn’t do anything special to justify the price. 



**Wall Shelf**



**The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG HG HG. This seems to be a controversial product, but I am in love. It’s finely milled and inexpensive. I’ve never had great luck with any vitamin c product, but this has provided Results. I mix it with an aha/bha, and my skin is Glowing. 

**Yu-Be Moisturizing Skin Cream - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. This cream gets me through the winter. So thicc, and I love the camphor scent. On my second jar. 

**Apothecary Extracts Tea Tree Oil - WRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
On the shelf because the bottle is pretty. I’ll occasionally mix a miniscule amount in with a toner or essence if my skin is acting up. 

**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
HG. What PIH? It helps more with active spots to keep them from scarring. I haven’t seen much improvement from older marks with this alone. 

**Hylamide Glow Booster - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌** 
It makes me look alive / not a vampire / not orange.

**Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate - On the Fence - 🐌🐌🐌🐌**
New addition. Loving it so far, feels incredibly elegant and sinks in well. But slightly worried about all the essential oils and strong fragrance. 

**Sunday Riley UFO Oil - WNRP - 🐌🐌🐌**
Managed to snag this for $30. There is no way it’s worth full price. It’s nice but does absolutely nothing more than a reasonably priced oil does.

**Sunday Riley Good Genes - WNRP - 🐌🐌**
Meh. It’s nice, but I have so many other products that give me The Glow, I don’t notice any difference using this. Definitely not worth the $$$$ or the hype.

**Curology - RP - 🐌🐌🐌🐌🐌**
1st month - 0.009% tret, 1% clindamycin, 9% aza
2nd month - 0.018% tret, 1% clindamycin, 8% aza

I used TO’s rosehip seed oil. I’d say they’re very similar in texture. Borage oil might be slightly thicker, but they both absorb really well for me. For reference, I cannot get argan or marula oil to absorb. They just sit on my face. 

I like rosehip seed oil for the high linolec acid and claims that it can lighten acne scars. I don’t think I saw any fading from it alone, but I figure I like it enough and maybe if I use it long enough? Borage oil is also high in linoleic acid, but has claims to help eczema, which I don’t have.

The texture of the niacinamide never bothered me, but I mix it with Cosrx snail essence and it applies really well. 

I use the glycolic acid every other day or every day if I’m breaking out. I don’t think most people use it this much, but it works for me. 

Lol. I feel nothing when I put it on. When I first found this sub, I was like “what’s a moisture barrier and how does everyone keep damaging it?” I think my skin should be studied for its high tolerance. 

I think the LAA Powder is a great alternative, but you need to mix it with the right thing. I believe the pH should be 3-3.5 for maximum results. But some people mix it with oil to avoid irritation. Also, only use 1/4 or 1/2 a scoop of powder. It’s powerful stuff! Got some slight tingling with a full scoop 😄",4281,niacinamide,ingredients,-5

I was using Azelaic Acid after waiting about 5 mins to let NZ dry totally and also patted it into my skin, then proceeded with my Rosehip oil and moisturizer. I never had an issue with piling. But I also wait about 5 mins until I apply more products on time.

Now I use the AZ acid as the final step in my skincare routine only bc it leaves a nice matte texture to the skin. It was recommended to me by a couple ppl on this sub and from what I can tell, it’s not hurting the results as well.

TO products are pretty concentrated. A lot of ppl seem to have an issue with the piling but it has never been a problem for me with this technique. 

Everyone’s skin is different though! You may have to play around with it.

Just remember that a little goes a long way with these products.",3616,niacinamide,ingredients,1

- people who have one specific major issue, like cystic acne, eczema, rosacea, or scarring or an unfortunate birthmark or burn, just one main thing that is serious enough to see a derm.  

- people who are skincare junkies and have fried their moisture barrier with acids, or have good skin but want laser treatments or dermaplaning or some other mostly unnecessary beautifying procedure.  

- people who are freaked out about something like a mole and aren't concerned with their skin in general, but need to be sure whatever it is doesn't mean cancer (or some other awful issue).

The first group don't need an extensive skincare routine, they only need a regimen that will help their concern (or a prescription for Accutane).  The second group need to lay the hell off their 12 step routines and calm down.  And the third group just want to know they aren't going to die and don't care about what cleanser they use, if any.

None of those people need or want the dermatologist to offer suggestions on a complicated routine with a ton of products for preventative skincare maintenance.",925,accutane,products,-12

At night I use micellar water to remove sunscreen, second cleanse with the Avene cleanser, apply P50, then spritz with CoQ10 toner and top it off with a few more drops of squalane.

[Product Question] Has anyone ever tried a 100% hyularonic acid serum?,8,1,1,8hfno2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hfno2/product_question_has_anyone_ever_tried_a_100/,ClearHue,"From the clinical studies I’ve read, 1-2% hyaluronic acid is all you need to get the moisturization and collagen building benefits (depending on molecular weight). More than that, the hyaluronic acid actually becomes more dehydrating because it’s incredibly hygroscopic and will suck the moisture out of your skin. Also, higher concentrations of hyaluronic acid makes the solution thicker and less cosmetically elegant. 

Most formulators refer to hyaluronic acid as the powder form sodium hyaluronate , so it’s impossible for them to claim that they have 100% hyaluronic acid. I’m suspecting the products you listed is defining hyaluronic acid as a 1-2% solution of sodium hyaluronate. So, it would essentially be the same thing as 1-2% hyaluronic acid serum without additives from other brands.",6288,hyaluronic acid,ingredients,-6

The Issue: Acne & acne scars all over my face. Mostly on cheeks.

Skin Type: Quite dry

Current Routine: My doctor prescribed Benzaclin to me. I have been using it for a little over 3 months. I suppose it has helped a bit, but we're still not there yet. A few weeks ago my doctor prescribed me Differin topical 0.1%. She said to use one in the morning and one at night.

My problem is, my skin has always been very dry. After using just the Benzaclin once per day for 3 months, it has gotten way worse. My skin literally peels off. I started introducing the Differin into my routine and I'm afraid that my skin is going to become unbearably dry. I used to use Cetaphil cleanser, but about one month ago I switched to using African Black Soap because I wanted something more natural in hopes of it not drying out my skin. I do also put on sunscreen daily.

Should I stick with the black soap and these two prescribed products? Would it be okay to introduce a moisturizer into the routine? I was afraid that it might interfere with the other products so I've only been putting on moisturizer when my skin gets incredibly dry.

Does anyone have any suggestions?",70,differin,products,-8

[Sun Care] Alcohol in otherwise perfect mineral sunscreen?,6,4,2,8hotfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hotfq/sun_care_alcohol_in_otherwise_perfect_mineral/,Darker-Days,">Is alcohol as the 5th ingredient really that much of a problem? 

If you have a compromised moisture barrier or dry skin it alcohol in a high concetration used daily could cause some problems. Whether alcohol further irritates irritated skin is a very YMMV thing and it does depend on the rest of the formulation of the sunscreen.

>so if it helps to dry down the sunscreens, it shouldn't be that bad right?

My thinking is that alcohol *could* possibly pose some negatives in sunscreen function —not saying it always *will* but I think it can. 

Studies have shown alcohol consumption causes free radicals inside the body. Studies on cells in culture (*not on living humans or even on other living animals*) showed production of free radicals. No one who works for Paula’s website can seem to find a published invivo placebo controlled peer reviewed study showing this occurs on human skin when applied topically in either pure amounts or when diluted with inert ingredients, so until this happens this wont be a cause of concern to me

Alcohol is a penetration enhancer and [some have noted that alcohol based sunscreen formulations seemingly follow suit in allowing for increased absorbtion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11702366/) just like with other alcohol based cosmetics. 

Sunscreen, whether its made from organic or inorganic/mineral filters needs to dry down and form a even continous layer on top of the skin at a density 2mg/cm^2 to work effectively w/ the same spf found in lab testing.

Since people typically don’t actually apply sunscreen every two hours be concerned that a high amount of alcohol in a formula would cause the enough of the product to penetrate the skin quickly enough that it would lose efficacy much earlier than sunscreens w/ little to no alcohol. However I’m not saying this would definitely happen, I bet likelihood of this occrinf varies likely depends on the rest of the formula.


>Are there even in vivo studies that confirm that alcohol is bad in cosmetics, 

Depends on what you personaly define as bad. I did some digging because of this thread and through pubmed I was able to find this long review of the saftey of ethanol on biomedcentral [Click Here](https://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6673-3-26) I found it interesting enough to read nearly every section.

Its not discssing topical use on skin exclusively. It also reviews it for use in the oral cavity and ingestion, so somethings are only semi-relevant —but it does have a lot info on how alcohol can effect the skin. I it refers to many studies and  seems very unbiased. 

Summarizing the main relevant points:


- Scientific Studies and Saftey assements of multiple types of alcohol in cosmetics are sourced that recognize alcohol as safe for topical usage. However, some people feel this should still be up for debate because evidence over its saftey in scientific literature can be viewed as contradictory and some expirements on (non human) animals suggest it could possibly cause harm if used chronically. Overall there is a lack of evidence to associate topical alcohol use with an increased risk of cancer.

- Not causing cancer and being considered sadr overall doesnt mean there is no risk at all. When applied topically, alcohol acts a penetration enhancer (*often why its used in cosmetics, so the active ingredients will penetrate deeper*) so it is considered risky that contaminants or ingredients that aren’t considered safe when they penetrate past the upper layers of skin will cause hadm if they are present in a solution with alcohol. 

- Correlation between likelihood of getting skin cancer and chronic ethanol alcohol use in high amounts has been studied a decent amount over the years but evidence is contradictory. The article links to italian, danish, swedish, & american studies done on this published from 1988-to-2005 and all of them found that ethanol had no significant effect on likelihood of humans getting malignant melanoma. In contrast, three case controlled American studies published from 1990-to-2006 found that it caused “some” increase in risk melanoma. These studies seem to be where the concern of alcohol being a risk to skin health/saftey came from. Its noted that the latter studies didnt adjust for UV exposure so the possibility of the researchers mixing up the cause shouldn’t be ruled out. Also, **all** the aforementioned studies were testing chronic high usage of ethanol alcohol via ingestion/heavy drinking — so even though its the same chemical its effects on skin health shouldn’t be extrapolated to topical use. 

- Besides Melanoma cancer, studies have also been done to see if ethanol alcohol (ingestion) has the ability to increase risk of Basal cell carcinoma. The two studies cited found it does increase risk, but one study admits more research is needed for confirmation and the other says the results were “nonmontonic”

- Other concerns of ethanol alcohol posing risk to the skin come from a few studies suggesting heavy use can lead to the development of eczema, psoriasis, cellulitis and delayed wound healing— once again all the studies are based on ingestion and don’t necessarily apply to topical usage. Infact a study is mentioned (*link doesnt seem to work for me though*) where in a “semi invivo wound model” topical application 10% ethanol stimulated tissue in a way that can be interpreted as positive influence for stimulation of wound healing. 

- When studied *invivo* it’s been shown that ethanol alcohol may increase the intensity of erythema/sun damage in the skin following UV irradiation and how quickly it occurs. The cause of how it does this is said to be by reducing the amount of carotenoid antioxidants in the skin that can be obtained via ingestion or topical application. These antioxidants act as natural protection for the skin. Once again this study was researching the effects of consuming ethanol alcohol and not topically applying it to the skin

- Studies do exist where topical alcohol increased the solar radiation’s carcinogenicity. A 7.5 month study was done to test if ethanol alcohol (and aloe emodin) were actually potentially carcinogenic to the skin with chronic use with and without UV exposure. Murine skin that got treated with ethanol but got no UV exposure experienced no mutations or tumors so topical ethanol was considered noncarcinogenic. Skin that got UV exposure alone developed mutations and tumors. Skin that got ethanol and UV exposure got more mutations than the group that got UV alone, so ethanol was considered to have the potential of increasing the carcinogenicity of UV light. A similar study states that it was able to induce melanoma in murine skin by using of uv light with ethanol.

{*Personal opinions:  I don’t find the studies mentioned in the previous bullet point very convincing or alarming at all though. Reason I don’t find it convincing is probably obvious —they used mice. Labatory mice studies usually aren’t convincing ton me on there own. Use of them when it comes to researching many different human ailments, illnesses, and diseases are often underfire by researchers because compared to humans there are too many dramatic cellular, anatomic and metabolic differences. Inflammation, burns, & cancer are among some of the things they have been specifically called out for being unreliable for. Better animals can be used for studies like these— ex Porcune skin is similar in many ways to humans which is why pigs are often considered reliable to use in testing to study wound healing, burns, skin surgery, skin disease, dry skin, cosmetics etc. Reason I don’t find it alarming — hypothetically if this is true in human skin, it still doesn’t take into account people who would use sunscreen (properly) on the same areas. Many chemicals like aha and retinoids can increase photosensitivity but there isnt an increase in skin damage when sun protection is used. Even when sensitive ingredients are used in sunscreen the formula can still provide adequate skin protection (assuming its reapplied properly)*}

-  A small invivo study found that when ethanol alcohol, n- propanol, iso-propanol were diluted in specific hand rubs Transepidermal water loss, dermal water content and superficial sebum content didnt change significantly.

-  Multiple Invivo studies found that the mechanism of action of how ethanol alcohol acts as a penetration enhancer isnt necessarily good for the function of all the skin. Exposing the skin to pure ethanol “removed measurable quantities of the lipid barrier material from the stratum corneum” meaning in time this lipid extraction could lower barrier function. (*Though one of the studies found that this effect of short contact with ethanol is reversed within 24 hours, I think this warrents avoiding cosmetics with alochol in high concentrations if you have a damaged moisture barrier, thin skin, dry skin, easily dehydrated skin, or are adjusting to certain actives*) 


-  A different small invivo study found when different percentages of isopropyl alcohol, isopropanol, including ethanol were patch tested or used to cleanse the skin there was no significant change in skin barrier function/TEWL nor was there change in skin irritation.

Hello,

26 female between acne and wrinkles, I'm dealing with both of these issues at night using both bioeffect efg serum and differin differin gel. 

My question is, which should I use first, serum or acne prevention gel?

My current night routine is:

Cleanse with Tatcha deep cleanse>Amore Pacific treatment toner>differin  gel>amore Pacific vintage single extract essence> bioeffect efg serum> whitening eye cream> Tatcha water cream.

Any cc would be highly appreciated!

Like I said in another comment, I had a really bad experience with trentinoin and I was on the same dosage that you were on. Around the 5 week mark, my skin was falling off in huge flakes and hurt so much I couldn't even touch my face, so I just gave up on the tret. It's possible that if the tret is causing the problem it may still take a while for your skin to heal after stopping it. 

Also, and I'm no expert here, but it seems to me if the tret is causing the problems, then switching toothpaste is not going to help. 

Yesterday I was reading about allergic contact dermatitis and how the allergy develops over time after repeated exposure to an allergen. Allergic dermatitis is usually incredibly itchy, which is making me think maybe I was starting to develop an allergy to the differin. 

I don't have any plans to see a doctor at this time (mainly because I can't afford it right now haha) but I'm not sure if I'm going to bother trying to use the differin again. I think I may switch to different actives after I give my skin time to heal because I don't want to risk it if I have an allergy. I mean it's only been 2 days since I stopped using differin and my eczema is already almost completely gone, so I definitely think differin was the culprit. 

Personally, I think you're best off right now just focusing on healing the irritation through moisturizing and the other things people have recommended on here to heal a damaged moisture barrier. That's what I am doing and it has helped a ton. ",3306,aha,ingredients,-11

Like I said in another comment, I had a really bad experience with trentinoin and I was on the same dosage that you were on. Around the 5 week mark, my skin was falling off in huge flakes and hurt so much I couldn't even touch my face, so I just gave up on the tret. It's possible that if the tret is causing the problem it may still take a while for your skin to heal after stopping it. 

Also, and I'm no expert here, but it seems to me if the tret is causing the problems, then switching toothpaste is not going to help.

"[B&A] Four months on Curology: from literally wanting to cry every time I caught my reflection to being comfortably makeup-free in public. Thank you, SCA!",2497,1,0,8h898v,https://i.redd.it/zv998u8y32w01.jpg,Doghorsesqueak,"Story time for anyone who’s interested! 

I always had decent skin as a teen. Got the occasional zit here or there, but mostly looked smooth as a porcelain doll as long as I used my Proactiv regularly and didn’t fall asleep in my stage makeup. 

At age 18 I got a prescription for birth control and took the pill all through college. My skin was flawless even without proper skin care, but I was an emotional trainwreck with horrible mood swings. (Read: I once burst into full-bodied sobs because I spilled Diet Coke on my Econ notes.) 

By age 23 I finally thought, “hey, maybe tricking my body into thinking it’s pregnant ALL THE TIME isn’t such a great idea.” Talked to my doctor and switched to a non-hormonal IUD. 

No side effects for the first month. Welp, that was easy, right? 

WRONG.

A month later my hormones went haywire and took out five years of suppression on my face. 

My face looked like a volcanic range - huge red mounds and deep, inflamed cysts littered my cheeks and jaw line. Every time I would manage to zap one with blemish cream, five more would show up the next day. My skin was so swollen and tender that it hurt to sleep on my side at night. 

Not only was it painful, it was MORTIFYING. I had never suffered from severe acne before, and my self-esteem took a huge hit. I tried everything I could to fix it or hide it. I took zinc pills. I cut out sugar. I changed my pillow case every night and scrubbed my makeup brushes til the bristles snapped. I spent hundreds of dollars on top-of-the-line concealers, primers, and creams, and I scoured internet boards for hours for at-home solutions. 

When all of those methods failed, I went back to my doctor. I cried in their office while they gave me a gentle “there, there” and promised me it would die down once my hormones settled. I was given a Retin-A prescription, which I diligently applied every night for 12 weeks straight with barely any improvement. 

After a year of fixating, I gave up. My hormones had leveled out somewhat. While I was no longer getting painful cysts, I still had chronic breakouts. I’d resigned myself to an adulthood of bad skin. I spent the next 6 months trying to accept it and focus on fostering self-love that wasn’t based around my appearance. 

This past January I happened to come across a Curology B&A on this subreddit. I had seen Curology ads before on social media but had always been skeptical. Decided to give it a shot anyway. I figured at worst it would just get my hopes up like the Retin-A prescription did. 

While my skin still isn’t perfect, I am so pleased with the results!! This is the first time I’ve compared my pictures since starting the program, and I’m shocked at the difference.

It’s also the first time I’ve felt optimistic about my skin in a year and a half, so thank you. I’m beyond grateful to you guys for convincing me to try it out! ",5948,retin-a,products,-27

The benzoyl peroxide would work: it starts off with big red bump that hurt, after 2\-3 days the swelling would go down and a white dot would appear.

[misc] Why is there such a disconnect between Dermatologists and modern skincare?,157,47,0,8i5k6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8i5k6d/misc_why_is_there_such_a_disconnect_between/,dr_amir,"Coming from the medical side, I definitely can empathize with a lot of these comments. I think there are a couple things to keep in mind though:

\-When a Derm is calling skincare products crap or not willing to recommend any, it's usually \(hopefully\) because they understand that the clinical evidence for many \(not including acne and other derm conditions\) of the products out there doesn't exist or isn't statistically relevant. There are really only a few products and ingredients out there have statistically significant, quality research behind them, such as using SPF daily and the benefits of Vitamin C \(as long as it is a stable derivative\)

\-When a patient is looking for ""real"" results, these need to be completed at the dermal layer of the skin. The vast majority of products on the shelve sonly deal with the highest layer of skin, the epidermis, where cells turnover every 6\-8 weeks anyway, so any changes at that level are temporary \(this is why they tattoo into the dermal layer\). The best way to target the dermal layer are with things like micro needling, certain lasers, fillers, and botox. Even here, results are temporary, but temporary means 8\-12 months, not weeks.

\-All that said, everyone should do their own research and, I agree, derms should be willing to sit down and explain this information, rather than dismissing all products. 

Hopefully that provided some useful information! Keep researching and stay educated on what it is you're buying. Sometimes drug store brands are perfect and other times its worth spending more to get a better, stabler product for the best results.",935,vitamin c,ingredients,10

Aquaphor is also fine. Something that has been suggested is an allergy test that involves not being able to get sticky allergen-filled patches on my back wet for upwards of a week (so no showers or hair washing), a lot of appointments that require travel, time needed off work and expense that I cannot put forth at the moment. I am not convinced that this is an allergy at all. Oddly enough the seems to flare up with my menstrual cycle, but my dermatologist doesn't seem to think that there is a correlation. The skin feels tight and dry even if it doesn't look flaky 100% of the time. The tight feeling extends down to my top lip and out to my cheek. It is on both sides of the crease of my nose, and occasionally by the sides of my mouth as well, right in the corners.

I've been on spiro for a year total. I started 200mg in January and I became 100% cyst free very quickly. Unfortunately, I started to have unpleasant side affects, so I've been on 150mg for 2 months now. Last month I had one tiny cyst, and now this month I have two painful cysts on my chin. 

Besides lowering my dosage of spiro, in the past two months I've changed two things in my routine.

I’ve been on several different contraceptive pills testing out the best one and all they did was make me fat. Took a testosterone test because I thought I was highly androgenic and it came back within normal ranges. Took several antibiotics (and would not take them ever again because they ruined my gut health) pretty much I have been on every prescription medication available except for Accutane and Spironolacton. Tried different food eliminations that wasn’t successful either. 
I’m currently using Tazorac and some TO items and my skin is just ok. I don’t have inflamed acne just the ones that hang around forever and never come to a head.

after nearly a year of lurking, trying new products and getting nowhere with them, I‘m here to ask for help. 

[This](https://imgur.com/a/rtCecEV) is my skin. Irritated, neither oily nor dry in general but small dry patches next to my nose, extremely prone to scars, seldom a bigger pimple but lots of small ones, redness, very large and sunken in pores and PIH that lasts for the better part of a year. 

It‘s been that way for the last 10 years (before that it was „normal“ pubescent acne: bigger pimples, more oily but less redness and my pores weren‘t as irritated). I‘ve got PCOS, so it‘s probably hormonal. But even when I was on special bcp my skin looked exactly the same as now. When I stopped taking birth control my dermatologist prescribed me Differin. Worked on the bacne that I developed
after going off the pill. But on my face? Didn‘t make an ounce of a difference. In the last two years, I‘ve tried BHAs (PC BHA 2%, PC BHA 1%, Cosrx) and AHAs (Cosrx and one from a brand around here). Of course not at the same time. Starting every three days and working up to every day. My skin didn‘t get irritated, just a bit dry but even after consistent use it looked exactly the same. I am using  Effaclar duo+ at the moment, but I can‘t see an improvement.

What kind of ingredient do you think will help me? My dermatologist wants me to go on Roaccutan but as I am trying to conceive that‘s not possible. I would be so grateful, if you could help me!

My current routine:
AM:
- Effaclar Gel Cleanser (seems a bit harsh but it’s the only cleanser that doesn‘t give me breakouts or red patches)
- TO hyaloronic acid
- Weleda Almond Moisturizing Cream for Sensitive Skin
- SPF 50 dry touch fluid (local brand, only one till now that doesn‘t break me out, better than bioré etc. for me, gives an even appearance and is great under Make-Up. Definitely my HG.)

PM:
- Garnier Micellar water with the pink cap

[This](https://imgur.com/a/rtCecEV) is my skin. Irritated, neither oily nor dry in general but small dry patches next to my nose, extremely prone to scars, seldom a bigger pimple but lots of small ones, redness, very large and sunken in pores and PIH that lasts for the better part of a year. 

It‘s been that way for the last 10 years (before that it was „normal“ pubescent acne: bigger pimples, more oily but less redness and my pores weren‘t as irritated). I‘ve got PCOS, so it‘s probably hormonal. But even when I was on special bcp my skin looked exactly the same as now. When I stopped taking birth control my dermatologist prescribed me Differin. Worked on the bacne that I developed
after going off the pill. But on my face? Didn‘t make an ounce of a difference. In the last two years, I‘ve tried BHAs (PC BHA 2%, PC BHA 1%, Cosrx) and AHAs (Cosrx and one from a brand around here). Of course not at the same time. Starting every three days and working up to every day. My skin didn‘t get irritated, just a bit dry but even after consistent use it looked exactly the same. I am using  Effaclar duo+ at the moment, but I can‘t see an improvement.

What kind of ingredient do you think will help me? My dermatologist wants me to go on Roaccutan but as I am trying to conceive that‘s not possible. I would be so grateful, if you could help me!

My current routine:
AM:
- Effaclar Gel Cleanser (seems a bit harsh but it’s the only cleanser that doesn‘t give me breakouts or red patches)
- TO hyaloronic acid
- Weleda Almond Moisturizing Cream for Sensitive Skin
- SPF 50 dry touch fluid (local brand, only one till now that doesn‘t break me out, better than bioré etc. for me, gives an even appearance and is great under Make-Up. Definitely my HG.)

PM:
- Garnier Micellar water with the pink cap
- Effaclar Gel Cleanser
- Effaclar duo+ (every other day)
- TO hyaloronic acid
- Weleda Almond Moisturizing Cream

I will note that I like the feel of TO’s much better because the melazepam is a bit grainy and doesn’t absorb as well. However this doesn’t bother me enough to stop using it given how quickly it’s helped my skin. ",996,azelaic acid,ingredients,-2

1. Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre: so far really   liking this, it’s a light moisturizer which feels good on the skin, and doubles as a primer from what Ive heard.

2. Ialucet: it’s a hyaluronic acid creme. I really like this creme because it plumps up my skin BUT if you’re in a hurry this créame takes time to sink in. I usually put it on a damp face and then go about getting dressed etc. to give it some time because giiirrl, for a few minutes you’ll look like IT lol

3. La Roche-Posay Anthelios XL spf 50+ (anti-shine):
This right here is my ultimate HG, I have combo to oily skin and this will keep the shine at bay, and this is coming from someone who looks like a bucket of oil was splashed in her face come summertime lol. 

4. LRP cicaplast lip balm: this is a good balm, my lips went through Hell this past winter and this has helped with the healing, really like it.

A very simple, base routine to start with is to use a low pH Cleanser, moisturize, and use sunscreen daily. Start with that immediately, to help repair your skin while you learn more about skincare and specialty products (serums, masks, ampoules, oils, actives, etc).

CeraVe face care is inexpensive and easily available, balanced for your skin's pH, and has ingredients to restore your skin's natural barrier. 
For acne care, with your starter routine, I like the Body Shop's Tea Tree line, and the Tea Tree Mattifying Moisturizer is not greasy and doesn't clog pores.

I have TO Cold Pressed Rose Hip Oil.

Anyway - I've always used argan with no issues. I use it sometimes post clay mask to massage out some grits. Sometimes undereyes, also.

I rarely eat sugary foods and I rarely ear or drink sugar (except in kombucha and alcohol - but no sodas, etc) and I am pretty hydrated - but I am going to try for a gallon a day and see what happens.

I know I need to add AHA and BHA in some capacities, but I'm confused as to which I should start with first. I have used Paula's Choice in the past and just went too hard with too many products at once, so I will be more deliberate and slow with any new products, esp actives.

I kept having problems with hormonal acne after having my baby. I finally gave in and went to a dermatologist. I*knew* it was hormonal— it started after my period returned and had all the normal hormonal signs. I had expensive allergy tests done (didn’t make a lick of difference) and was prescribed retin-a micro and aczone with zero instructions. They gave me samples to start and I had no idea what to do with these medicines so I used them 2x a day all over, no moisturizer and no sunscreen because they didn’t tell me to!! Knowing better now, I’m horrified! I ended up with perioral dermatitis and they gave me oral minocycline even though in my chart it stated I was still nursing (big no no!). I also mentioned it every visit. Thank God I remembered
from my own field that nursing was a contraindication to minocycline and I called them and they were like, “stop taking it immediately!!” I’m paying you people a fortune to help me, I shouldn’t have to be my own doctor! Thank God I never started it. 

Anyway, in the end, they only made my skin worse and I’m working on repairing my very damaged moisture barrier. My skin is looking better than it has in years. They didn’t even help me treat my eczema. I just threw hundreds of dollars at them for worse results. 

Sorry for the long vent...I just really relate to this post. I’m sure there are good derms out there, but this was a highly rated practice and I can’t afford shopping around other offices. Oh well! Makes me thankful I found this sub!

Other brands have HA based moisturisers, like [Neutrogena gel](https://www.neutrogena.com/skin/skin-moisturizers/neutrogena-hydro-boost-water-gel/6811047.html).

[Skin Concerns] Do facemasks work?,4,12,0,8i8tfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8i8tfn/skin_concerns_do_facemasks_work/,hambre_sensorial,"Sheet masks are a combination of mask + product, and the type of product can be whatever (meaning it can contain a lot of things! It could have some acids to exfoliate, just antioxidants, whitening agents, etc.) Normally Asian face masks have just very basic hydrating liquid, with some antioxidants and...basically that's it. If they contain other things, like for example niacinamide, most of the time you won't be able to notice big changes in just one application. Leaving the sheet on your skin may help with penetration of some ingredients but, in general, they are pretty useless if you already have a solid routine (meaning they hardly add anything important, just extras), and they are pretty expensive if you compare the cost of application vs. a normal product.  

All things considered, I still use them time to time because they feel like extra pampering and relaxing, but they are not necessary at all. Of course, it would depend on each person's routine, I imagine for some masks are a way of getting some ingredients or for example special things (like a higher level of occlusion that may help with sporadic dehydration and such) in their routine with frequent use, but again, cost of application tends to be high even with the cheaper ones.",1588,niacinamide,ingredients,0

I also have combination/oily skin, especially on the nose and chin. This moisturizer takes a little while to fully absorb and feels tacky for about 15 minutes. But once it soaks in....omg. My skin is dewy, glowy, and, more importantly, I don’t look like a grease trap by lunch!

Edit: I just realized you were asking for one with SPF. Sorry, no SPF in this product but I use Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch on top of this, and it doesn’t make me too oily. ",5816,hada labo,products,0

Anyone who has gone on a skin care journey has tried numerous products that for whatever reason didn't perform well, but were nonetheless expensive enough that throwing them in the trash causes hesitation. I try to buck that tendency as much as I can, and either resolve to use up the less than amazing products on my hands, or just toss them out if they cause allergic dermatitis or some other troublesome condition. I basically can't tolerate anything with fragrance or exotic botanical ingredients, and I did not realize that until somewhat recently. I'm also transitioning away from Deciem products, so I'm just going to use up what I have and not repurchase anything from them. The products are fine, but I'm getting better results with CeraVe and Hada Labo, so I don't need to give Deciem any more of my money. I think the biggest area of my skincare graveyard has been sunscreens. I can't tolerate chemical sunscreen at all, and of course I also can't tolerate fragrance, so a lot of them have gone into the trash. ",508,hada labo,products,-5
[misc] Why is there such a disconnect between Dermatologists and modern skincare?,157,14,0,8i5k6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8i5k6d/misc_why_is_there_such_a_disconnect_between/,HappyGoPink,"""Modern skincare"" is driven by advertising and marketing. There are many brands that call themselves 'skin care', but they all have one thing in common. They want to sell you something. And they're not legally obligated to sell you something *useful*. If they could put lard in a tub and sell it to you for $90, they would. 

A good dermatologist is going to tell you what you don't necessarily want to hear, that you have to be realistic about what you can expect from anything you put on your skin, and there are only one or two really transformative products (and they are sunscreen and retinoids/vitamin A derivatives). There are some other useful ingredients out there, but that's just the thing, you need to recognize when a product has good ingredients, rather than believing the laundry list of claims on the bottle, tube, or tub. 

And if the product has fragrance in it, pass it by. Fragrance is the leading cause of sensitivity and allergic dermatitis. But cosmetic companies keep putting fragrance in their products because uneducated consumers want a product that 'smells nice'. These same people probably can't understand why they can't get rid of the persistent redness in their skin. 

The fact is most of the best products are pretty basic and not that expensive, and if you are using sunscreen and a retinoid, the rest of your skin care should just be about preventing trans-epidermal water loss and preserving barrier function. Skin is a BARRIER. It is designed to keep things OUT. So don't expect a miracle cream to erase years of bad decisions. ",902,vitamin a,ingredients,-6

I was the personal assistant to a Mary Kay national sales director (AKA the top of the pyramid of the pyramid-scheme). She required me to use the products. 

My skin was awful. I had insane CCs and pimples. She told me once to ""cover my entire face in BP 10%- it'll go away and your skin will be dry, but it'll go away. It worked for me"". 

I thought my bad skin was because I was wearing makeup every day. I was brainwashed into thinking Mary Kay skincare was the best one the market. 

So when my skin was super dry, I thought, ""Mary Kay might help!"" The moisturizer felt good on my face, but now that I'm thinking about it, my skin has HURT ever since I used it. 

My good friend is a consultant, and I bought the foundation and moisturizer from her. I don't want to return the stuff because I don't want to seem... Stuck up about it. I used to work with her back in my MK days and I didn't leave on good terms (couldn't handle the brainwashing and manipulation). 

I'm very curious about other people's experiences with the brand. ",3512,bp,ingredients,-8

My skin is so close to being the way i want it too, and it feels good when i use the cerave sunscreen, but the residue makes me look crusty and i dont like it...

TLDR: I need tips on how to use sunscreen to fight acne. ",3935,tretinoin cream,products,-2

Walnut Shell Powder - physical exfoliant

Organic Aloe Vera Juice - moisturizing

Decyl Glucoside - gentle soap

Lauryl Glucoside - normal soap

Cocamidopropyl Betaine - coconut based soap

Phenoxyethanol - preservative

Lower down the list are some flower waters (for fragrance most likely), some oils and vitamins, and some other extracts. These all look good except they're pretty low on the list so they're not super strong but some is better than none! Alcohol is really low on the list, which is nice, but still present which is not nice for people sensitive to alcohols. 

Overall it's got a pretty clean ingredient list but you could get similar results with St Ives and a good moisturizer. ",6337,aloe,ingredients,11

Currently trialing the Alturist SPF30, you get 2 x 200mls of product in a no frills tube. It causes a grey cast on my dark skin which demands makeup correction. Which is too much effort for me. I'm on day 3 now and have a few Cc's on my left cheek and a big module on my jaw on the right. This maybe due to impending TOM, which is due within 36hrs. And counting. It also has 3% glycerine which can be dehydrating in dry weather. Doo stepped up the moisturising and oil occlusion last night. 

I posted on Euro skincare exchange the 2nd unused tube last night. I am really quite happy about trying to sell it. As it is a mammoth amount of SS that I can't use on my body due to grey cast.... unless I want to use body makeup. Just no. 

I have 2 x 50ml of old formula SS in my stash as well as 1 x 50ml of new formula SS. So no immediate panic but still I would like an easily accessible SS going forward.  

I have 2 new products in my stash that is waiting to be tested. Both from TO. But waiting until the SS is locked in to test them out. 

A friend told me my aloe Vera gel that I use every day, had been reformulated to contain phenoxyethanol. I have used this product for 10yrs and have a 200ml back up in my stash box. So a year of this aloe Vera and then looking for a replacement.... so I have a while to think about it. 

One thing I am noticing is that my hold on skincare buying has meant I am looking at makeup. I rarely wear the stuff as skincare is my bag. But I like the pretty colours... yesterday I TMO of buying brushes in Superdrug. Very impressed with myself. But last night spent a long time looking at Fenty Beauty products, namely the magic stix. The Matte ones have coconut oil in them, so no. And the highlighter Sinamon highlighter stick, looks beautiful. But when would I use it?? So back to my eyeshadow stash... I have some powder shadows that could dupe the look, if I really want it. So there is that.  

I will use my eyeshadow as a eye liner today... but my eyebrows need a lot of attention. I have one person who threads them nicely but she isn't always in. I am trying to keep the tweezers away..... 

My hand cream, lano lips rose intense, is still going. I don't find it particularly moisturising, but is conditioning.  Looking forward to replacing with another product when I'm done. 

Trying to pan a lip gloss that is more like a lip balm. This keeps on going. Jeeeze.... but perseverance... 

I actually used the cuticle serum last night on nails both hands and feet. I need to do a 28day challenge of using it twice a day as directed. To see if it works. I let it soak in, then used my facial oil to massage and hydrate my nails.... so the challenge begins.

I have 1/3 left of a Superdrug HA facial mist left, very perfumed and not suitable for my face. However for my hair it is Great! Spray at night, spray a little water and make sure to seal in with a little castor oil. Once it is gone I am thinking of buying a HA as an ingredient to add to a DIY hair moisturiser spritz. So this will be my repurchase, along with some raspberry seed oil to use on my scalp and hair. But that is it as I can get carried away with DIY purchases!! 

Phew . thanks for reading.... it is good to think about where I am going with this hobby of mine. 🤔😀

I’m struggling with skin that refuses to keep makeup on – within about an hour/an hour and a half it’s all melted off! I believe I have a combination skin type where my t-zone is oily and shiny and everything else is fine. I am in the UK.

I’ve had two different trains of thoughts in relation to products I use… I thought ‘Yes, oily t-zone I must use salicylic acid and charcoal stuff and pore minimising whatevers’ but I noticed absolutely no change. Some people and Dr. Google suggested that my skin my actually be too dry and producing oil to compensate, so after about two weeks on the ‘oil elimination’ attempt I switched to more hydrating products, but still saw absolutely no difference. 

The products I used that were advertised as more oil elimination:

-	Cleanser – Super Facialist Salicylic Acid Purifying Cleansing Wash for a bit and then switched to Bioré Charcoal Cleanser
-	Moisturiser – Boots’ Shine Control Day Moisturiser (which I also used at night)

Used them morning and night, applied cleanser to damp skin with cleanly washed hands and the moisturiser was left for at least 5 minutes before I started applying makeup.

I then switched to the hydration products as follows and am currently using it:

-	Cleanser – Super Facialist Rose Hydrate Cleanser
-	Moisturiser – Neutrogena Hyrdo Boost Water Gel

Again, used morning and night, applied to wet skin with clean hands and the moisturiser is left for at least 5 minutes before makeup.

I don’t use toner because I’ve seen no difference when using it. If I can sort this problem out first I may start incorporating one into my routine again!

The makeup I’ve tried have all been mattifying and not oil-based and I have tried so many different variants of foundation/primer/setting with absolutely nothing working.

Absolutely nothing seems to help my t-zone appear less oily. Interestingly, the best my skin looks is after I’ve been swimming – I’m half tempted to bottle some chlorine-y pool water and apply that instead since my skin looks so nice and my makeup afterwards actually stays…!

So yes… am I missing anything? Are there any products that you can recommend that are better than what I’m using? Here for any advice you wonderful people may be able to give me :) ",6725,salicylic acid,ingredients,7

Cerave PM is great as well. I'll use this one AM and/or PM. Same as above applies for this one.

My skintype is now normal, acne prone. When my skin was dry/dehydrated both of these were not moisturizing or hydrating enough for PM use alone so I would always add a few drops of TO squalane oil.

 On the same level as these for an array of reasons.

The spf looks like a nice one to try, but it’s getting overzealous when saying it’s basically a one come all in the spf world. Just bc most people have different preferences. Some can’t tolerate the fatty alcohols in this. It is pa+++ which is good but if someone wants the best there are pa++++ out there. It contains tinosorb which is cool but also Octinoxat (Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate), Tinosorb S (Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine), Ensulizol (Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid), Neo-Heliopan E 1000 (Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate), and Titanium Dioxide. So if someone is wanting a mineral only spf, this is a horrible recc. Personally I prefer pa++++ with tinosorb and physical spfs, for instance. Hard to find. Though I suppose everyone has their Own preferences it is lofty to say one basic spf is a cure all to the rest.

The types of acids, dr Dennis gross has up to I believe 15 different types of acids in one package! Plus..... you can only use TO 30% peel 2-3 times a week... maybe 4 MAX without completely wrecking your moisture barrier. Dr Dennis gross you can literally use everyday. **big difference**.

- organic grapeseed oil, one of the highest in oleic and linoleic acid, resveratol, omega 3, omega 6, vitamin E. Don’t use too much. **jojoba, grapeseed, emu oil are my favorite**. Emu helps anything put over or under cross the phosopholipid barrier and cross deeper into the epidermis.
- lock everything in with **Cera ve ointment**.

*things to have in your arsenol*
- [stratia liquid gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold) a combo of niacin amide, cholesterol, other important ingredients in the right combo that can be added to your routine without going through the ordinary mindfuck.
- [Niod flavonne mud mask](https://niod.com/product/flavanone-mud-50ml) a detox, purifying, protective, and responsive face mask. One of the few masks to actually have.
- [sand & sky Australian pink sand mask](https://www.sandandsky.com/products/porefining-face-mask?gclid=CjwKCAjw8r_XBRBkEiwAjWGLlEsTmoQ11ttOxcIhjRimI45vSCk5xNX70MQNWfD5JDGmaGg5cO727BoCUIMQAvD_BwE) Just do it. Have this in your kit because it Detoxes your skin and makes it look like brand new baby skin with small pores.
- [biologique recherche mask Viviant](https://www.paullabrecque.com/products/biologique-recherche-masque-vivant-3-4-oz) You won’t be able to get this, but eventually hopefully down the road in your skincare journey you will understand why I am recommending this. One of the best in the world.
- [Aztec secret healing clay](https://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Cleansing-Original-Bentonite/dp/B0014P8L9W?th=1) a good clay mask that is multi-purpose. Can sprinkle in your bath with some epsom salt with a very, very detoxing bath. Or with a packet of aveeno (or off brand) colloidal oatmeal packs for calming, soothing yet detoxing bath.
- [taste knockout tingling treatment ](https://tartecosmetics.com/en_US/skincare/knockout-tingling-treatment/1209.html) You want to see your pores disappear and your skin stay nice and balanced? Use this the night before. It’s pure magic. I’ve never used biologique recherche pm1970 but I can only imagine this is the closest it comes.
- [biologique recherche p50 pigm400](http://shoprescuespa.com/lotion-p50-pigm-400.html) regulates melanin productions, evens and brightens skin.
- [melazepam 20%](https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Formulas-Melazepam-Cream/dp/B001WUEJ4U) I personally am eventually going to try this, it’s iffy to recommend this because I haven’t tried it.... but it’s definitely on my list.... for an even and brighter complexion. I’ve tried The Ordinary 7% azelic acid and that was cool but not much of a difference. This seems like you would actually see a significant difference. I personally use retin A and have for 16 years now, nothing would work as good (none of these products) without my retin a. Pore size would not be what it is today without it. Melazepam=Azaelic acid or whatever. It prevents re-keratinization, is an anti microbial, anti-inflammatory, and some other shit. This plus retin A are like a golden combo. Def on my amazon wish list.
- the ordinary 30% aha bha acid peel or whatever. One of the only TO products actually worth owning in my opinion. The rest are a clusterfuck that crowd up your sink and look cool. But only serve one individual purpose. Usually a mild one at that. By that way, watch that caffeine solution bc that can be very very drying. It *can* help with mild puffiness but lymphatic massage helps more to drain the fluid and all together help the cause, versus a solution that is going to dry out your skin in the end all.


That’s all I’ve got. Obviously this is not a go out and buy all these products at once, but I do believe that every single product on this list would help your skin. The major ones being tarte knockout treatment, sand and sky mask, la Roche posay toleraine purifying foaming face wash, pixi nourshing cleansing balm, botanicals 3-1 micellar water, cosrx snail mucin, dr jart ceramidin serum, and the dr Dennis gross exfoliating lotion. Frambroos is magical too. Gosh. Just everything here. But those specifically are my hard hitters. If I had to go buy something right now to try and see results, it’d be tarte knockout tingling treatment. The results on resurfacing are amazing. Buy that and jojoba oil, it’s moisturizing, just pat it in. Cera Ve makes a big difference in occluding your products and really making them soak the fuck in,.

##I say this because I had skin just like yours about 3 months ago and I wasted my money on all these “HG” products everyone talked about, and they were pure shit. Find what YOUR skin likes girl,. And don’t go balls out all at once. Try one thing and see how your skin reacts, then start introducing like products. Don",4434,jojoba,ingredients,26

- lock everything in with **Cera ve ointment**.
- [la Roche posay double repair moisturizer UV SPF 30](https://www.laroche-posay.us/toleriane-double-repair-moisturizer-uv-3337875545846.html#q=Double+repair&start=3) Use this as a daily spf, it helps dehydrated skin.


*things to have in your arsenol*
- [stratia liquid gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold) a combo of niacin amide, cholesterol, other important ingredients in the right combo that can be added to your routine without going through the ordinary mindfuck.
- [Niod flavonne mud mask](https://niod.com/product/flavanone-mud-50ml) a detox, purifying, protective, and responsive face mask. One of the few masks to actually have.
- [sand & sky Australian pink sand mask](https://www.sandandsky.com/products/porefining-face-mask?gclid=CjwKCAjw8r_XBRBkEiwAjWGLlEsTmoQ11ttOxcIhjRimI45vSCk5xNX70MQNWfD5JDGmaGg5cO727BoCUIMQAvD_BwE) Just do it. Have this in your kit because it Detoxes your skin and makes it look like brand new baby skin with small pores.
- [biologique recherche mask Viviant](https://www.paullabrecque.com/products/biologique-recherche-masque-vivant-3-4-oz) You won’t be able to get this, but eventually hopefully down the road in your skincare journey you will understand why I am recommending this. One of the best in the world.
- [Aztec secret healing clay](https://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Cleansing-Original-Bentonite/dp/B0014P8L9W?th=1) a good clay mask that is multi-purpose. Can sprinkle in your bath with some epsom salt with a very, very detoxing bath. Or with a packet of aveeno (or off brand) colloidal oatmeal packs for calming, soothing yet detoxing bath.
- [taste knockout tingling treatment ](https://tartecosmetics.com/en_US/skincare/knockout-tingling-treatment/1209.html) You want to see your pores disappear and your skin stay nice and balanced? Use this the night before. It’s pure magic. I’ve never used biologique recherche pm1970 but I can only imagine this is the closest it comes.
- [biologique recherche p50 pigm400](http://shoprescuespa.com/lotion-p50-pigm-400.html) regulates melanin productions, evens and brightens skin.
- [melazepam 20%](https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Formulas-Melazepam-Cream/dp/B001WUEJ4U) I personally am eventually going to try this, it’s iffy to recommend this because I haven’t tried it.... but it’s definitely on my list.... for an even and brighter complexion. I’ve tried The Ordinary 7% azelic acid and that was cool but not much of a difference. This seems like you would actually see a significant difference. I personally use retin A and have for 16 years now, nothing would work as good (none of these products) without my retin a. Pore size would not be what it is today without it. Melazepam=Azaelic acid or whatever. It prevents re-keratinization, is an anti microbial, anti-inflammatory, and some other shit. This plus retin A are like a golden combo. Def on my amazon wish list.
- the ordinary 30% aha bha acid peel or whatever. One of the only TO products actually worth owning in my opinion. The rest are a clusterfuck that crowd up your sink and look cool. But only serve one individual purpose. Usually a mild one at that. By that way, watch that caffeine solution bc that can be very very drying. It *can* help with mild puffiness but lymphatic massage helps more to drain the fluid and all together help the cause, versus a solution that is going to dry out your skin in the end all.


That’s all I’ve got. Obviously this is not a go out and buy all these products at once, but I do believe that every single product on this list would help your skin. The major ones being tarte knockout treatment, sand and sky mask, la Roche posay toleraine purifying foaming face wash, pixi nourshing cleansing balm, botanicals 3-1 micellar water, cosrx snail mucin, dr jart ceramidin serum, and the dr Dennis gross exfoliating lotion. Frambroos is magical too. Gosh. Just everything here. But those specifically are my hard hitters. If I had to go buy something right now to try and see results, it’d be tarte knockout tingling treatment. The results on resurfacing are amazing. Buy that and jojoba oil, it’s moisturizing, just pat it in. Cera Ve makes a big difference in occluding your products and really making them soak the fuck in,.

##I say this because I had skin just like yours about 3 months ago and I wasted my money on all these “HG” products everyone talked about, and they were pure shit. Find what YOUR skin likes girl,. And don’t go balls out all at once. Try one thing and see how your skin reacts, then start introducing like products. Don",4434,aha,ingredients,26

- [stratia liquid gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold) a combo of niacin amide, cholesterol, other important ingredients in the right combo that can be added to your routine without going through the ordinary mindfuck.
- [Niod flavonne mud mask](https://niod.com/product/flavanone-mud-50ml) a detox, purifying, protective, and responsive face mask. One of the few masks to actually have.
- [sand & sky Australian pink sand mask](https://www.sandandsky.com/products/porefining-face-mask?gclid=CjwKCAjw8r_XBRBkEiwAjWGLlEsTmoQ11ttOxcIhjRimI45vSCk5xNX70MQNWfD5JDGmaGg5cO727BoCUIMQAvD_BwE) Just do it. Have this in your kit because it Detoxes your skin and makes it look like brand new baby skin with small pores.
- [biologique recherche mask Viviant](https://www.paullabrecque.com/products/biologique-recherche-masque-vivant-3-4-oz) You won’t be able to get this, but eventually hopefully down the road in your skincare journey you will understand why I am recommending this. One of the best in the world.
- [Aztec secret healing clay](https://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Cleansing-Original-Bentonite/dp/B0014P8L9W?th=1) a good clay mask that is multi-purpose. Can sprinkle in your bath with some epsom salt with a very, very detoxing bath. Or with a packet of aveeno (or off brand) colloidal oatmeal packs for calming, soothing yet detoxing bath.
- [taste knockout tingling treatment ](https://tartecosmetics.com/en_US/skincare/knockout-tingling-treatment/1209.html) You want to see your pores disappear and your skin stay nice and balanced? Use this the night before. It’s pure magic. I’ve never used biologique recherche pm1970 but I can only imagine this is the closest it comes.
- [biologique recherche p50 pigm400](http://shoprescuespa.com/lotion-p50-pigm-400.html) regulates melanin productions, evens and brightens skin.
- [melazepam 20%](https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Formulas-Melazepam-Cream/dp/B001WUEJ4U) I personally am eventually going to try this, it’s iffy to recommend this because I haven’t tried it.... but it’s definitely on my list.... for an even and brighter complexion. I’ve tried The Ordinary 7% azelic acid and that was cool but not much of a difference. This seems like you would actually see a significant difference. I personally use retin A and have for 16 years now, nothing would work as good (none of these products) without my retin a. Pore size would not be what it is today without it. Melazepam=Azaelic acid or whatever. It prevents re-keratinization, is an anti microbial, anti-inflammatory, and some other shit. This plus retin A are like a golden combo. Def on my amazon wish list.
- the ordinary 30% aha bha acid peel or whatever. One of the only TO products actually worth owning in my opinion. The rest are a clusterfuck that crowd up your sink and look cool. But only serve one individual purpose. Usually a mild one at that. By that way, watch that caffeine solution bc that can be very very drying. It *can* help with mild puffiness but lymphatic massage helps more to drain the fluid and all together help the cause, versus a solution that is going to dry out your skin in the end all.


That’s all I’ve got. Obviously this is not a go out and buy all these products at once, but I do believe that every single product on this list would help your skin. The major ones being tarte knockout treatment, sand and sky mask, la Roche posay toleraine purifying foaming face wash, pixi nourshing cleansing balm, botanicals 3-1 micellar water, cosrx snail mucin, dr jart ceramidin serum, and the dr Dennis gross exfoliating lotion. Frambroos is magical too. Gosh. Just everything here. But those specifically are my hard hitters. If I had to go buy something right now to try and see results, it’d be tarte knockout tingling treatment. The results on resurfacing are amazing. Buy that and jojoba oil, it’s moisturizing, just pat it in. Cera Ve makes a big difference in occluding your products and really making them soak the fuck in,.

##I say this because I had skin just like yours about 3 months ago and I wasted my money on all these “HG” products everyone talked about, and they were pure shit. Find what YOUR skin likes girl,. And don’t go balls out all at once. Try one thing and see how your skin reacts, then start introducing like products. Don",4434,aha,products,26

For long term results I’d recommend adding in Differin to promote cell turnover. In the meantime, a good way to get the cysts to come to a head is to use Smile’s Prid. It’s this tiny orange tin and it smells like death, so apply a little to the cyst with a q tip and cover with a bandage. It’s an old school drawing salve and the tin lasts forever.

Rather than going to new routine (even if it is simple), I'd go back to your old routine right now and try to get back to baseline. It sounds like your previous routine was working better than what you're dealing with now, and it would give you a starting place to gauge whether new products are helpful or aggravating to your skin. Going forward, add products to your routine slowly and one at a time. Maybe keep a calendar or journal to help you find correlations. Use COSDNA to find patterns in the ingredients that break you out.

I also started using products from The Ordinary, which has helped a lot. I enjoy their products because a) inexpensive and b) many of them are simple and don't contain 15 million ingredients which can break you out. If I try their squalane oil and break out, it's easy to say ""oops, guess my skin doesn't like squalane oil!""

After CeraVe I used Cosrx Low-PH Good Morning Cleanser for a few months. It worked well for me and I liked it, but it was a bit drying for my skin (especially in the winter months). I switched to Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser in September and LOVE it. It's expensive but it's my HG cleanser and one bottle lasts 3-4 months when used 2x/day for me.

For moisturizing, I switched from CeraVe to layering TO Squalane Oil, Cosrx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, and Mizon Snail Recovery Gel. I have dry skin and these got me through the winter in a very cold/dry climate, which was amazing to me. When I feel on the dry side, I also add in Mizon Black Snail All In One Cream.

For the first four months, I was on a combination of 4% azelaic acid/1% clindamycin/4% niacinamide. During that period, I didn’t get a single cystic pimple! Then after those four months were up, I got one :( My provider switched my formula to 8% azelaic acid/1% clindamycin/0.25% zinc pyrithione. I haven’t had another cystic pimple since!

Overall, I am very happy with Curology. It made a huge difference with my skin. I rarely get pimples, and it’s smoothed out the texture and redness. It was also super nice to have a provider to talk to. She answered some of my random skincare questions regarding other products besides Curology, which is an awesome resource! I would definitely recommend Curology to everyone!

My routine:

**AM:**

- Splash of water

- TO Vitamin C

- Vanicream 50 SPF sunscreen


**PM:**

- Hada labo HA foaming cleanser

- Thayers rose petal witch hazel

- Hada labo gokujyun HA

- Curology

- Cosrx snail mucin power essence 

- DE Shaba complex eye serum

- Either TO Squalene or DE marula oil.

I also use DE Framboos night serum once a week and hydrating sheet masks 2-3 times per week!

I haven’t really made any other big changes besides the Curology. I did make a few other small changes. I think ceramides cause me to get cystic acne, so I’ve cut all products with ceramides out of my routine. I live in a very dry climate, so I try to focus on hydration and moisturizing.

I've started to use tret on my neck and decollete, not just my face, for anti-aging benefits.

I *had* to break the skin because they were deeper than a normal whitehead, and always solid inside when I did.  It would bleed, but honestly look fine a day later, maybe two.   I don't know if this applies to you, but my skin in the affected areas was fking invincible. It rarely reacted to actives or exfoliation of any kind - even tret .1%.

I've been reading [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) and  what I thought was every pore (like you), was actually every follicle (hence: folliculitis).  I was diagnosed with KP, and I treated it like KP for years - and I did see minor improvement.  But now, looking at the list of safe products on that site, I see that the products I was using were actually anti-fungal or proven not to feed it/make it worse.  

That overlap, and the fact that it didn't *look* like the fungal acne I see on SCA and Google images, led me to think it wasn't.  I just used the nizoral for the third time though, and it's making an undeniable difference - which is so bizarre to me given how resilient and deep these little plugs are.  It's bananas.

I just purchased my first tube on Friday and I did see that there was mention of not seeing results for a few months. Which people can take one way or another - it just depends on if they are familiar with skincare or not. Differin has made many, many people purge. But on the other hand, there are people who haven’t had that purging experience. 

I’ve seen people purge at 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and even further didn’t purge until a month and a half to two months. As with everything, YMMV. I don’t think you sound defensive, I totally get that lol. I like to debunk everything I hear...I play devil’s advocate without meaning to. As the song Warning x Green Day says....”Sanitation, expiration date, question everything
Or shut up and be a victim of authority” lmao I know the rest of it doesn’t apply but the *question everything* is what I’m getting at here lol.

However it’s totally possible to get non fungal breakouts from it. I got a normal breakout from the avene emulsion. 

However your fungal acne doesn’t go away without treatment. So treating it is a good thing to do. 

You can try them after you treated the fungal acne or just use them up as a décolleté or body cream. But if its breaks you out in non fungal acne I wouldn’t. But it’s up to you. I would highly recommend to do a patch test first. Do it for a week or two just to make sure. You can also use COSdna to see what ingredients all those moisturiser have in common. And avoid that moisturiser. 

I love the eucerin ultrasensitive soothing care for normal to combination skin. Because my skin is dry I add a few drops of squalane oil. These are both FA safe.

It could be hard to tell, but if normal acne treatments don’t work or other skincare products make it worse that could indicate fungal acne. 

If its normal closed comedones adding a BHA should work. The Paula’s choice skin perfecting BHA liquid. This is also good for fungal acne.

Last year my skin /life/ was a hot mess and I decided it was time to do something. Glad it worked 🤠
(I'm 20 yo and located in Belgium) [THEY/THEM]

Little background story : I stopped eating properly in 2014-2015 and when I got my eating disorder under control, I decided to go vegan. I then had no periods for a year and also no acne...? Weird.
I had a TERRIBLE 2016 year (not that the 2 years before were much better), my periods came back and in January 2017 my skin was worse than ever. It was literally grey and red.
In september 2017 I had a good skincare routine and stuck to it until I *cough* found love.

I made some changes and now use my products religiously everyday. It helps with my mental health too. I'm no longer 100% vegan but I still don't consume straight up dairy or meat/fish/eggs. It messes with my hormones and I always get cystic acne 😬 alcohol is also a trigger it seems 😢


My skin is normal, but a bit dehydrated. I have KP on my arms/legs/butt and Idk if it also affects my face 😐 I have yet to identify what causes the redness I see.

What improved : 80% of my cystic acne disappeared, my chin is less red and rough, my fine lines look better, my forehead...shines?, overall my skin is more plump and less dull ☺ 
I still get pimples around my mouth but they heal faster. I never got scars despite picking my skin for decades but for some reason started getting PIE 2 years ago :(. I think vit C is working though :)
My freckles are also disappearing :0


Products used in order (* products I bought in February) (○ only PM)

○Etude House House Mascara remover : 🌸🌸🌸🌸, I love how it feels on my *very sensitive* eyelids and it gets rid of all my HolikaHolika mascara so 🖒

Cosrx Low PH Cleanser : 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 HG, it just does what it says and I love the smell for some reason? I use it on a konjac sponge. 

*Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence : 🌸🌸🌸 🌸Good but I miss the Galactomyces one tbh? Also I use a lot more product with this essence. I notice the glow though!

○Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid : 🌸🌸🌸 not sure it did anything for my skin? At least it doesnt break me out haha. BUT, I use it on my armpits and its AMAZING. My sweat doesnt stink like it used to.

*Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC Intensive Anti Spot Essence: 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 Im starting to see results on my PIE 😍 and I just love how it applies and the smell. I also feel it smh allows me to use less hydrating products on my face??? (I use this 6 times a week, AM or PM depending on my mood)

○Intelligent Cosmetics Rosehip Oil: 🌸🌸 Its okay. Doesnt do anything special for my skin but it does work on my lips. I use it on my eyelashes sometimes, when I dont feel like using castor oil.

Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask : 🌸🌸🌸 for some reason it really didnt work the first months I used it. I would wake up with dry skin and it would pill under my makeup. But now I find that its a great daytime moisturizer and makes my skin glow??? I want to know what change in my skin/routine or who knows, the weather, made this work for me 😂
Definitely not a good night cream for me on its own though.

Secret Key Starting Treatment Eye Cream Rose Edition : 🌸🌸🌸 it's okay for the price. Never had any issues with it and that's all I ask for. It absorbs quickly which is great because I don't have that much time to do my makeup next.

○*Rosette Ceramide Gel: 🌸🌸🌸🌸 first time I used this changed my life. My skin was SO PLUMP. But my issue is that it sits on my skin for like half an hour and it's sticky. I sometimes spray water on my face to avoid the stickiness but I'm really not sure I should be doing that 😂

*Kruidvat Solait Sensitive skin for face spf50: 🌸🌸🌸🌸 it's cheap, has great sunscreen ingredients, it's very liquidy and doesn't spread easily but that's ok. Doesn't look matte or greasy and feels velvety to me. It's also available everywhere I go 👏
(Warning: the body version is sticky)

Empties :

Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner : 🌸🌸 I used this for way too long but I remember liking it a lot the first month of using it.
The second ingredient is alcohol though, and I also remember my skin feeling very dry haha.

Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence: 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 HG will switch back to this when I finish the snail muffin (*MUCIN*) essence. I just love it that much. I only needed a pump and a half and it spread so easily and felt great. My skin felt like velvet after using this Idk WHY but it did.

Anyway thank God I found this sub 🙏🙏🙏

*Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC Intensive Anti Spot Essence: 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 Im starting to see results on my PIE 😍 and I just love how it applies and the smell. I also feel it smh allows me to use less hydrating products on my face??? (I use this 6 times a week, AM or PM depending on my mood)

○Intelligent Cosmetics Rosehip Oil: 🌸🌸 Its okay. Doesnt do anything special for my skin but it does work on my lips. I use it on my eyelashes sometimes, when I dont feel like using castor oil.

Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask : 🌸🌸🌸 for some reason it really didnt work the first months I used it. I would wake up with dry skin and it would pill under my makeup. But now I find that its a great daytime moisturizer and makes my skin glow??? I want to know what change in my skin/routine or who knows, the weather, made this work for me 😂
Definitely not a good night cream for me on its own though.

Secret Key Starting Treatment Eye Cream Rose Edition : 🌸🌸🌸 it's okay for the price. Never had any issues with it and that's all I ask for. It absorbs quickly which is great because I don't have that much time to do my makeup next.

○*Rosette Ceramide Gel: 🌸🌸🌸🌸 first time I used this changed my life. My skin was SO PLUMP. But my issue is that it sits on my skin for like half an hour and it's sticky. I sometimes spray water on my face to avoid the stickiness but I'm really not sure I should be doing that 😂

*Kruidvat Solait Sensitive skin for face spf50: 🌸🌸🌸🌸 it's cheap, has great sunscreen ingredients, it's very liquidy and doesn't spread easily but that's ok. Doesn't look matte or greasy and feels velvety to me. It's also available everywhere I go 👏
(Warning: the body version is sticky)

Empties :

Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner : 🌸🌸 I used this for way too long but I remember liking it a lot the first month of using it.
The second ingredient is alcohol though, and I also remember my skin feeling very dry haha.

Cosrx Galactomyces 95 Whitening Power Essence: 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 HG will switch back to this when I finish the snail muffin (*MUCIN*) essence. I just love it that much. I only needed a pump and a half and it spread so easily and felt great. My skin felt like velvet after using this Idk WHY but it did.

Last year my skin /life/ was a hot mess and I decided it was time to do something. Glad it worked 🤠
(I'm 20 yo and located in Belgium) [THEY/THEM]

Little background story : I stopped eating properly in 2014-2015 and when I got my eating disorder under control, I decided to go vegan. I then had no periods for a year and also no acne...? Weird.
I had a TERRIBLE 2016 year (not that the 2 years before were much better), my periods came back and in January 2017 my skin was worse than ever. It was literally grey and red.
In september 2017 I had a good skincare routine and stuck to it until I *cough* found love.

I made some changes and now use my products religiously everyday. It helps with my mental health too. I'm no longer 100% vegan but I still don't consume straight up dairy or meat/fish/eggs. It messes with my hormones and I always get cystic acne 😬 alcohol is also a trigger it seems 😢


My skin is normal, but a bit dehydrated. I have KP on my arms/legs/butt and Idk if it also affects my face 😐 I have yet to identify what causes the redness I see.

What improved : 80% of my cystic acne disappeared, my chin is less red and rough, my fine lines look better, my forehead...shines?, overall my skin is more plump and less dull ☺ 
I still get pimples around my mouth but they heal faster. I never got scars despite picking my skin for decades but for some reason started getting PIE 2 years ago :(. I think vit C is working though :)
My freckles are also disappearing :0

But still, if you find something that works and doesn't harm your skin or health in the long run it doesn't matter, right?

It’s kind of a pain but I’ve made 50$ here and there. 

What I really like to do though is donate items to women’s shelters. I keep all the stuff I don’t want from my Ipsy bags, random nail polishes or body lotions I didn’t like, etc in a box. A few times a year I call my area’s shelters and drop off the box. It’s such a small thing to us but women who are escaping violent situations usually leave with the clothes on their back. A little lipstick can go a really long way towards helping someone feel special or beautiful again. I’m lucky enough to be able to indulge in self care and some expensive skincare and cosmetics - I feel like this is honestly the least I can do to pay it forward to other women. 

I did have to call around to a few different shelters before I found one who accepted donations. Also every time I buy tampons at the store I buy an extra box and toss it in the donation box. Feminine hygiene products are something that usually gets overlooked when people donate (as opposed to, say, toothpaste.)

my first ""big"" breakout that i now think of as fungal was after i used a mask (Julep Night Shift, btw), with it's second ingredient being ""C10-18 TRIGLYCERIDES,"" which is (according to the EWG, which i take with a grain of salt, but this is just their straight up definition) ""a triester of glycerin and a mixture of normal and branched chain C10-18 fatty acids."" after using this, i broke out in little cc's all over my forehead centered RIGHT in the middle of my t zone. i kid you not, every single pore there was clogged. in about 7 days of absolute babying (only aloe vera gel, vaseline, and washing with cetaphil gentle cleanser) these bumps all went away. i thought it was an allergic reaction i'd never had before.


about a year later, i bought a new bottle of foundation (Revlon Colorstay). the day after using it, i broke out in the exact same reaction, but this time there was also a patch of very rough, bumpy, plaque-like skin by my hairline. where the rest of my skin was smooth, the texture there appeared almost striated, with horizontal lines and big cc's as well as MANY blackheads. i trashed the foundation, and after about a week of my same routine from before, the cc's went away entirely. however, the dry skin did not. clay masking helped some of the cc's go away, but to this day i still have many blackheads in that area, as well as a few cc's. i've tried aha, bha, physical exfoliation, but they've not yet disappeared.


a few months after that, i bought a bottle of rosehip oil. i thought i could use these to moisturize and to maybe help some leftover PIH i'd had from a nasty breakout. however, a few days after i began using the oils, i noticed my cheeks were COVERED in blackheads, as well as my forehead. my forehead and cheeks also had new cc's, along with the area surrounding my nose. my skin's texture is overall much worse than it's ever been. i'm still dealing with the aftermath of this, and it's been a drain on me.


recently, i learned about fungal acne from reading the famed simple skincare science post. i'd known what it was, but hadn't really considered i had it... after all, i had blackheads, and i've never heard of blackheads being part of fungal acne. but as i went back and looked at what caused me to break out, i've realized there's a link!


the **C10-18 tryglicerides** in the mask i used are **made with chain 10-18 fatty acids.** **Malassezia feeds on C11-24 fatty acids.** no wonder i broke out so badly- malassezia food was the **SECOND** ingredient.


the foundation i used had **PEG-10**, which is an ether of rapeseed oil. this is also malassezia food :/ it also contained Polyethylene Glycol Stearates, upon which fungus loves to snack!


and of COURSE, jojoba and rosehip oil are food for fungi... **jojoba oil is mostly composed of a C20 fatty acid**, Eicosenoic acid, and rosehip oil is **high in linoleic acid, which again** (C:18:2 and C18:3) **feeds the beast.** 


right now, i've cut back my routine hugely to only products that fungal acne won't metabolize. i remove makeup with simple micellar water, cleanse with cetaphil gentle cleanser, moisturize with cerave moisturizing cream, and use elta MD uv 46 clear sunscreen. i've also been treating my acne with 10% de la cruz sulfur ointment, and cutting out tretinoin that i used to use until i can get these clogged pores to a better place. 

i'm currently suffering some setbacks (i bought cerave PM by accident thinking it was fungal acne safe! heads up... it's not!) but i'm actually seeing some improvement in my oddly textured patch of skin right now from the sulfur treatment. things are looking bright, y'all.",7334,jojoba,ingredients,-24

my first ""big"" breakout that i now think of as fungal was after i used a mask (Julep Night Shift, btw), with it's second ingredient being ""C10-18 TRIGLYCERIDES,"" which is (according to the EWG, which i take with a grain of salt, but this is just their straight up definition) ""a triester of glycerin and a mixture of normal and branched chain C10-18 fatty acids."" after using this, i broke out in little cc's all over my forehead centered RIGHT in the middle of my t zone. i kid you not, every single pore there was clogged. in about 7 days of absolute babying (only aloe vera gel, vaseline, and washing with cetaphil gentle cleanser) these bumps all went away. i thought it was an allergic reaction i'd never had before.


about a year later, i bought a new bottle of foundation (Revlon Colorstay). the day after using it, i broke out in the exact same reaction, but this time there was also a patch of very rough, bumpy, plaque-like skin by my hairline. where the rest of my skin was smooth, the texture there appeared almost striated, with horizontal lines and big cc's as well as MANY blackheads. i trashed the foundation, and after about a week of my same routine from before, the cc's went away entirely. however, the dry skin did not. clay masking helped some of the cc's go away, but to this day i still have many blackheads in that area, as well as a few cc's. i've tried aha, bha, physical exfoliation, but they've not yet disappeared.


a few months after that, i bought a bottle of rosehip oil. i thought i could use these to moisturize and to maybe help some leftover PIH i'd had from a nasty breakout. however, a few days after i began using the oils, i noticed my cheeks were COVERED in blackheads, as well as my forehead. my forehead and cheeks also had new cc's, along with the area surrounding my nose. my skin's texture is overall much worse than it's ever been. i'm still dealing with the aftermath of this, and it's been a drain on me.


recently, i learned about fungal acne from reading the famed simple skincare science post. i'd known what it was, but hadn't really considered i had it... after all, i had blackheads, and i've never heard of blackheads being part of fungal acne. but as i went back and looked at what caused me to break out, i've realized there's a link!


the **C10-18 tryglicerides** in the mask i used are **made with chain 10-18 fatty acids.** **Malassezia feeds on C11-24 fatty acids.** no wonder i broke out so badly- malassezia food was the **SECOND** ingredient.


the foundation i used had **PEG-10**, which is an ether of rapeseed oil. this is also malassezia food :/ it also contained Polyethylene Glycol Stearates, upon which fungus loves to snack!


and of COURSE, jojoba and rosehip oil are food for fungi... **jojoba oil is mostly composed of a C20 fatty acid**, Eicosenoic acid, and rosehip oil is **high in linoleic acid, which again** (C:18:2 and C18:3) **feeds the beast.**

Routine: 
Neutrogena Pore Refining Exfoliating Cleanser (usually at night)/ Sometimes I also use the First Aid Beauty Face Cleanser 
Toner: Pixi Glow Tonic (mornings, sometimes at night) 
First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (night/morning) 
La-Roche Posay Ultra Light Mineral Sunscreen (morning) 

I am interested in trying the Glossier Milky Jelly for the morning? And for help in the evening with makeup remover? I also have some eye darkness and a few wrinkles under my eyes, so I am looking for something that might help with that too.

[Pics](https://m.imgur.com/a/k85iEzb) 

it’s all along my jaw line. I shave, and i use warm water, shaving cream, and a toner as an aftershave. I’ve been washing my pillow cover constantly. I’ve been making sure my makeup brushes are clean. I wash my face after sweating when i’m working out. My birth control i’m using is one that’s supposedly help with acne too (Beyaz). I didn’t have problems with it before I started taking it and suddenly it’s been rampant lately. 

I need serious help. :( 

I’ve been using Purity by Philosophy to wash my face for years but it’s just not working anymore, so I bought Cetaphil’s face wash. I haven’t incorporated it yet but i will be starting today. I also bought some nip+fab glycolic fix cleansing pads and cerave sunscreen. I’ve already been using a Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer with SPF 30 i believe before i put on make up. i haven’t incorporated those yet.

I use BP. As the comment below states you can try contact therapy for less irritation. The other thing to note is that 2.5% strength is just as good as 10% but less irritating.

 BP bleaches your clothes. It's very annoying. So I wash my hands right after using. Religiously. They also sell affordable BP proof pillow cases at Walmart or you can get some white cotton ones.",3939,bp,ingredients,-9

> Should I also start using an aha?

It depends on why you want to add an AHA. If you have an issue like closed comedones a BHA on its own doesn't work for some people. Adding an AHA does the trick by sloughing off the top layer. If your skin is doing fine with BHA alone there's no need to add AHA or another active.

Cystic acne like I’ve never had in my life, crazy redness and dryness. I stopped using anything at all (even cleanser) threw all products from the ordinary away (every one of them upset my skin) and washed with just water or used jojoba oil to take off sunscreen on days I wore it. Used only aquaphor to moisturize. And only wore my Nivea sunscreen milk if I was gonna be in the sun for a while. 

All my irritation and pimples went away. My dryness was solved and now I use about 3-products that I introduced slowly. I wash with vanicream if I fee greasy or dirty otherwise I use just water. I use Nivea sunscreen the Japanese milky essence one. For some extra hydration I use kikumasamune high moist toner underneath aquaphor at night. 

My suggestion is to stop using everything. Like, if you can stand using just water to wash your face do that for a week or 2. Then use a super basic gentle cleanser like vanicream or cetaphil if you need something more. Then try aquaphor to seal in moisture after you shower rather than creams or lotions. To take off makeup or sunscreen use a basic oil. Keep it as basic as you can for as long as you can.",6182,jojoba,ingredients,-5

The clay mask in itself isn't an exfoliant or anything that directly interacts with the differin, so I think it's just the question of how dry or irritated your face might become.

I just started using differin about a month as well, but have not been able to successfully reintroduce the Aztec clay mask into my routine because of how dry my skin has been just using differin once every 3 days.

If your skin is holding up well, I think you'd be fine to go ahead and try the aztec clay mask, but I'd suggest taking it slow. Maybe try adding a little more ACV and making it slightly watery and only leaving it on for 5 minutes the first time you do it and assess how dry your skin is the next day after.",3582,differin,products,-2

It sinks in the skin in a minute or so and feels smooth but not silicony. It is basically like putting on a very lightweight moisturizer. It does not peel either. I’m absolutely in love, and I highly recommend it! It cost $18. I hope this will help anyone looking for a sunscreen right now!

It’s called Black Girl Sunscreen and I believe it’s the best sunscreen for POC. It feels lightweight, moisturizing, has a natural finish and leaves absolutely no white cast or stickiness. It sinks in the skin in a minute or so and feels smooth but not silicony. It is basically like putting on a very lightweight moisturizer. It does not peel either. I’m absolutely in love, and I highly recommend it! It cost $18. I hope this will help anyone looking for a sunscreen right now! 

For info, here is my current routine. I have combination skin (oily T zone and dry cheeks), NC50. Right now I’m working on my texture and hyperpigmentation.

AM: 
Splash face with water

Simple micellar water

Hada labo premium lotion

PM:

Simple foaming cleanser (too drying, switching to cerave hydrating cleanser soon)

TO azelaic acid 

TO moisturizer

Vanicream Gentle Cleanser 

Cerave Moisturizing Cream


I believe the Cerave might have been too heavy as I was experiencing whiteheads on my temples while using it. I stopped using it and the micellar water (just in case) on May 4th and have just been using the Vanicream at night. Despite it being gentle and me pat drying my face...my face is tight after and I get little dry patches. But I want to dedicate some time to just use the cleanser to make sure it's not a culprit. 

Im afraid to introduce anything else until I know for sure my skin can handle it. I'm currently patch testing Cerave Baby, Avene Tolerance Emulsion and Sebamed Gel on my arms/behind my ears.  I really need a moisturizer but don't have a go to and I read when trying to start a routine trying one product at a time is a way to go.  I could probably use squalane as it was seemingly safe before but I'm not 100% sure. 

Tonight I'll be washing with the Vanicream and bottled water.  If my skin is still just as dry I figure my moisture barrier has to be very compromised and hard water isn't to blame.  From there I thought it might be a good idea to take a week where I either use the Micellar Water, bottled water or oil to cleanse instead because seemingly even a gentler cleanser is to harsh for my face in it's current state.

If anyone has input on what could be causing my issues or advice on steps I should take I'd love to hear it. Does it seem like fungal acne? The itchiness and bumpy texture is what makes me feel it could be. It

2. Either Suki Transformative Purifying Masque (https://sukiskincare.com/transformative-purifying-masque/) OR Suki Nourishing Facial Oil (https://sukiskincare.com/nourishing-facial-oil/)


These CC have been a part of my life since way before I started using Suki or facial oils (used to just buy whatever drugstore cleanser had the prettiest packaging and your basic oil of olay with SPF and that's it). I used to think they were blackheads but whenever I tried to squeeze them (yes I know better now) nothing came out and also I once went to the Ulta lady who does facials a few years ago and asked for blackhead extraction hoping she could get rid of them but they were still there after she finished and she didn't really say anything about them so I left that appointment being none the wiser on what to do about them.

Thanks in advance for any help SCA! (also ignore the big red pimple that is healing up in the pic because it is just from my period and from experience I know it should go away just fine and I am not worried about it)

Ill double cleanse in the PM with Cerave foaming cleanser, just to make sure I got all the sunscreen and makeup off and theres no grime left over. But for the morning I just oil cleanse now, ive only been using the oil cleanser for a month now and have seen amazinnngggg results in my dehydrated skin. Super plump and juicy and not sickly looking lol. I never noticed I was stripping my skin with those cleansers until I switched it up, recommended from someone on here.

I dont have trader joes or whole foods, but I found a rosehip seed oil cleanser called Wrinkle Therapy by Avalon Organics. Im sure they have roughly the same stuff, I would stay away from fragrant ones. That natural stuff can be intense sometimes just forewarning lol. Definitely smell it in the store haha. 

Otherwise, I would definitely incorporate an spf during the day as well. To prevent any further damage and aging from the sun.  I just use the Neutrogena Hydroboost in 50. Its a little greasy, but it makes my matte foundation go on smooth and flawless.  

Also, once your skins used to the new products you've chosen, The Ordinary makes some great products. I would try out some actives, AHA/BHA that'll help with some fine lines and a boost to your glow (get that sunscreen forsure), their Buffet serum is anti aging and has awesome reviews, but I absolutely love their vitamin c suspension. 

Always make sure to patch test new products and make sure if you do you use actives to use an spf and introduce them veryyy slowly. 

Good luck with your skincare journey🌈🌻.

I pretty much have to scrub with a wash cloth and it still isn’t out. I follow up with the CeraVe hydrating cleanser and I swear it clings to the lurking oil and looks like it is just sitting in my pores,like little CeraVe white dots just hanging out in my pores. I switched to a Shea peace rose oil cleanser for sensitive skinand the results were amazing for the first day but the next time I used it I had a horrific reaction so I’m back to the neutrogena for now because I looked like I had gotten lip injections and my nose peeled like crazy for two days.

From what I've seen fungal acne are tiny, non-inflamed red bumps on the skin without heads. Yours looks more consistent with cystic acne to me, large red inflamed lesions that don't come to a head/are unpoppable, and generally lots of inflammation and redness. 

Also based on the location of the majority of your acne and its severity, I think hormones should at least be considered. Have you had any blood work recently? Do you by chance take any medications that affect hormones (BCP, Spironolactone, Finestaride, etc?) Sometimes high-androgen birth control pills can cause acne. Or discontinuing birth control can cause it too.

Even if it's not hormonal, it's my personal opinion that cystic acne is not really suited for topical treatments. It just manifests so much deeper in the skin than comedonal acne, and topical treatments don't penetrate that far. In fact, they're pretty notorious for not penetrating that well in general. So if hormones aren't a factor/BCP doesn't help, Accutane is another option.

I had severe inflammatory cystic acne due to a hormone imbalance/possible PCOS that didn't look too different than yours, and BCP and Spironolactone cleared me up completely. For treating hormonal acne, it's extremely important that the birth control be low androgen. I don't know if any of this helps, I'm trying.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. And even though it's kind of a weird thing to say, I agree with the person about checking out Thataylaa's videos. It was pretty amazing how she could still be so positive and confident even when her acne was at its worse (and it was pretty severe.)",5184,accutane,products,-4

Not sure, because I've always had a terribly uneven/undefined lip line, but I suspect this may be the case. I don't apply either serum to my lips directly, but I end up with a little around the edges of my lips because I really want to get those anti aging ingredients around my lips because I used to smoke and want as much collagen production there as possible to prevent smoker's lines. You're not supposed to use Vitamin C on your lips directly, I have not heard that about Niacinamide, but apparently people are also using low-stregth tretinoin on their lips, which is a known lightener, by virtue of it's ability to drastically speed up cell turnover.

By the way I think you have good skin.

I'm wondering what else I could be doing to address some lingering concerns.

You can see I have one blemish at the base of my ear. I get these every so often and am not sure what to do about it; my routine has made this very infrequent, maybe once every 3-4 months. My remaining concerns are: visible pores/some white-heads on chin; dandruff? but also oily hair at the crown; light acne scarring on side of jaw; wrinkles.

My current routine, which I've been doing for 3-4 months:

**AM**

- Splash with water

- Thayer's Witch's Hazel toner (cucumber)

- TO HA + B5

- Glossier priming moisturizer

- Khiel's BB cream with SPF 50 or Maybelline BB cream with SPF 30


**PM**

- Wash face with Glossier milky jelly cleanser

- Toner again if there's still residue/makeup

- TO HA + B5

- TO Buffet (idk if this is doing anything)

- Stridex in the red box (either 1-2x week on face and neck or to spot-treat as necessary)

- TO Niacinamide (just started this)

- TO retinoid emulsion 2% (every other day)

- Kiehl's night cream moisturizer


ETA: I have skin that is neither dry nor super oily (so, combination?). I do get oily in my T-zone over time, especially under the BB creams.

If you’ve been using the Klairs toner and your skin likes it, I think doing the 3-7 layer method with it sounds like a good idea to add hydration to your routine. My skin didn’t like Cerave PM, but that was a heavier moisturizer than the gel-cream that I used and had to supplement, so maybe that and the additional toner layers might be enough as for hydration/moisturizing.

Also, I don’t know what activities you have planned out on your trip but when I went to Asia, I had to get a new sunscreen.

I used Stridex and it has helped the milia situation. Otherwise, going to the dermatologist and getting them removed was the most efficient way to remove the milia, because they just won't budge. Cetaphil gave me some CC’s so I removed it from my routine.

No idea for the CC’s on forehead issue. Stridex doesn't work except helping get them to the surface. I got this Pond’s cream with Lactic Acid in it and it is helping a bit. BP has helped but it is very drying. I think I might switch from Lactic Acid to Glycolic Acid.

You could get the smaller 4oz bottle for $15 if you wanted to try before committing.

I also really like La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Cleanser.  I feel that it cleanses well without stripping, but doesn't leave a film on my face like CeraVe and Cetaphil do.  It might be runnier than you want it to be though.

Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion is one of my favorite products too.  The name is accurate, it's extremely gentle on your skin.  Might be a little too rich for you, this one leaves more moisture on your face than LRP will, but I don't find it to be on the level of CeraVe or Cetaphil.  This one is my go to when my skin is very irritated.  The instructions say to apply it like cold cream or something, but I've used it like a normal cleanser and it works fine.

Avene also makes Tolerance Extreme Cleansing Lotion, which seems to be a similar concept, but more squalane based.  Might be more gentle or geared toward sensitive skin than the Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion.  It's totally free of cetearyl alcohol if you find that ingredient to be too rich for you.  Both Avene cleanser are about the same price as the Biologique one, but I think you get more volume.  Might be worth a shot if you are really sensitive.

While Cosrx Good Morning Gel Cleanser is cheap, I'm telling you right now that this is the opposite of what you're looking for.

Recencentley (1 month) ive added a non algal toner, eye cream, and vitamin c+magnesium serum to my daily/nightly routine of ceta Phil and olay spf for sensitive skin. In this month I havent seen much changes. So about 5 days ago I started using a clean and clear deep action cream cleanser because it contains salystic acid. I'm using this for now because its what I already had in my house but-- ibwas wondering if using a toner with SA would be better than using a face wash with SA? Also is there a better cheap face wash that contains SA? I remember using Neutrogena acne wash when i was in high school and I think it worked fine, but I was using it along with a prescription from a derm. 

Also how long should I stick with the same routine before I see results? Ive changed my facewash a few times this year.

[Skin Concerns] The Rosacea HG Thread: Share your skincare secrets! (Week 10),77,20,3,8hksvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hksvt/skin_concerns_the_rosacea_hg_thread_share_your/,LunarAmbrosia,"**If you have rosacea, avoid foaming cleansers like the plague.** Cream cleansers are your friend. You want to keep your skin really well hydrated at all times. I personally like La Roche Posay's Toleriane Hydrating Cleanser, which is about $14USD for a big bottle, because you can use it on wet skin and rinse it off. I like it better than LRP's Dermo Cleanser \(drying\) and CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser \(weird texture\). Nuxe's Comforting Cleansing Milk with Rose Petals \($20USD\) is a really nice option for a first cleanse, to take off SPF and makeup.

**A lot of having rosacea is trial and error.** For example, finding a sunscreen can be a challenge. Many people are sensitive to chemical sunscreens and prefer the mineral ones, but my skin doesn't like titanium dioxide \(it makes it itchy and irritated\) although just zinc is fine \-\- too bad it makes you look like a ghost and doesn't play nice with makeup. I've found that I can handle avobenzone, octinoxate, and a variety of other chemical sunscreens. My current favorite is LRP's Double Repair UV \($20USD\). Basically, I find that La Roche Posay works really well for my skin.

**Most importantly, a dermatologist might make the appearance of your rosacea go away, but he/she won't cure it, and the process of treating the symptoms might make your other health issues worse.**  Hear me out here. I'm pro\-science and trust Western medicine. But, in my experience, I went to a very prestigious dermatology clinic and was prescribed topical gels, an exfoliating face wash, a mild antibiotic, and eventually instructed to get birth control pills from the gynecologist. Really? All that when just quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol, and getting my diet and digestion right would make a way bigger difference in the long run? I had to figure this out on my own, and the process of taking antibiotics and birth control pills at the same time was *not* kind to my body. A majority of rosacea outbreaks can be contained if you just avoid triggers, and the easiest way to learn what those are is to eliminate everything, give it time, and document your day to day findings. Take a photo of your face everyday. Look at your digestive system. Pay attention to how well you're sleeping and your stress level. This is the long, hard way, but it's free, and it's something that you really have to do for yourself. No one can do it for you.

So those are my tips! Hope they're helpful.",96,cerave hydrating cleanser,products,0

[product question] What is the difference in function between a Vitamin C oil and serum? How should each be applied in a routine?,8,1,0,8ibtu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8ibtu8/product_question_what_is_the_difference_in/,madamcuan,"They are basically the same, the point is they are vitamin c treatment. However, your Korres one has the vitamin C in oil solution (the korres one uses a vitamin C derivative called Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate that’s oil-soluble) and they chose to name it an oil instead of serum as serums are usually water-based. Some companies have oil-based treatment but call it a serum. It’s just a matter of names.

The general routine guideline is water-based products go first, then oil-based products. You may put it before your moisturizer, but if post-moisturizer feels better then go with that. Usually people put on vitamin c in the morning for its photoprotective property, but night time is ok too, anything you’re comfortable with.

The general rules of products combinations for vitamin c usually refer to L-ascorbic acid which is not what you’re using. LAA derivatives are usually more flexible, so just do your research specifying the type of vitamin C you’re using, which is Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate.",1015,vitamin c,ingredients,6

So if you could achieve good results without differin that would be great. I started off using only differin (skin was too sensitive on differin to use anything else). After the differin cleared up most of me problems, I now use only a couple times a week, and use a salicylic acid/ witch hazel/ aloe  blend on the intervening days as needed.

The next week, four minutes. Two or three days later I broke out again, white heads and cysts underneath the skin (idk what to call those but they are painful, not like ccs). They are not in the same places on my face as the breakouts in March. Is it likely that the peel caused this? I cut out all actives from my routine immediately and am just using moisturiser (Sebamed gel), rosehip seed oil and the tiniest bit of Egyptian Magic at night/sunscreen in the am.

Don’t get me wrong, chemical exfoliation helped get rid of my cc’s and has been a great help but adding lots of moisture has been really the most transformative aspect - I’m wondering if it might help with redness for you? It’s helped me work on fading PIE scarring and just making my skin look so much more ‘alive’ I suppose.

I have the Innisfree Jeju Bamboo Sleeping Pack in my sights but haven’t actually tried it, heard great stuff though! However, I can speak for the CosRX Snail Mucin and that stuff is pretty magical! I’ve heard it does wonders for redness, I find it helps my skin look very bouncy and gives a nice layer of moisture and helps me absorb more moisture too.

This is totally YMMV, but I did used to use TO’s Niacinamide Serum daily. I went through about 2 bottles (approx. 5-6 months use) and repurchased another and found it now made my skin rather blotchy and irritated? It’s really rare for my skin to be reactive generally but there’s been a somewhat recent reformulation and after months of use, it now leaves a prickly feeling which I hate. It never made a huuuuuge difference for me regarding anything really but I did like using it and have heard it does make a big difference with redness. It’s pretty cheap so if you’re willing to test it out, that might be a high nicinamide option for you.

Also this is somewhat unrelated, but I think your routine seems pretty good. It can be easy to add lots of products in (as I have done) but I think to start simple and slowly build is definitely the way to go. I’m in the process of sort of marking out what is unnecessary/not of great benefit so that I find what 100% works. I think in the process of working towards your skin goals, really give one product a go in a long time before buying another - if you’re like me, the desire to try lots of new products kind of takes over but patience is key and will save you cash!

I believe over all it's not necessarily which diet you choose but rather you are making better food choices when eating.

Birth control question: Would you guys recommend I just flat out remove my Nexplanon birth control by the year mark? It is my second implant, and I know for sure it is the root cause of my acne.

My diet is very controlled and healthy, I stay away from sugary foods and have done my best at drinking a gallon of water a day since I started working out last year. 

I had normal skin years ago before Nexplanon. My skin was the one thing I was actually pretty confident about. I'd wager my skin is drier now than it used to be. Because I feel my skin is so sensitive, I've tried to keep my routine basic as per the advice I've gotten here in the past.

I remove make-up with petroleum jelly because I'm a dirt broke college student and cannot afford a multi-step routine, exfoliate gently with a multi-fiber cotton cloth, and use Cerave in the tub. I stopped taking Differin because my face was getting entirely too flaky, and it didn't seem to stop the barrage of acne even after passing the timeframe of ""purging"" that everyone talks about. It made my entire face feel like a raw sore. It also left me with a grid of scars on both cheeks. 

I'm tired of looking like this and I'm wondering if giving up on Nexplanon altogether would help. ",6704,differin,products,-2

BTW I disregard the instruction to apply using a cotton round - just tip a small amount into my palm and pat over my skin. Cotton rounds are too drying for my skin and they're wasteful in my opinion. I also use the 9% PC BHA as my spot treatment as my skin can't tolerate Benzoyl. Once it arrives you'll be all set to go!

I wish I could do more than give sympathy and a gentle reminder that acne takes time to heal, but given time and the right treatment you will get there.

Have you ever heard of Thataylaa over on YouTube? She used to suffer from acne like yours, and has made a number of videos over the years talking about confidence with acne and how she deals with acne like mentally rather than just the skincare stuff. Because acne does have an impact on your mental health too. She recently finished a course of accutane so she's less affected by it these days but like I say, her older videos could be worth checking out.

Let the toner dry then go in with the AHA gel. Let the gel dry then go in with the FAB cream. Also make sure you wash the AHA gel off your hands if you're putting eye cream on - don't want AHA too close the eyes! If your skin likes AHA, its fine to use it at the same time as Vit C - apply based on lightest texture - heavier texture principles.

Also recommend to patch test and start slow with AHA (every 3rd day maybe) - it can sting/tingle a bit at first but shouldn't still be tingling after 10mins. If it is, wash it off, wait a few days and maybe try mixing it with an oil or a moisturizer to ""buffer"" it. That being said 8% is a pretty low concentration and the PC range always has great formulations designed to minimise irritation.",6264,aha,ingredients,5

Also I looked up the Sukin Serum and if its the ""super greens"" one, maybe would consider dropping it from your routine as there's a few ingredients in there that can be problematic and increase inflammation including fragrance and carrot seed oil.

(Week 10),77,22,1,8hksvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hksvt/skin_concerns_the_rosacea_hg_thread_share_your/,MissScienceFair,"Aw yeah my time to shine! Some of this advice is going to repeat things already posted but this is what worked for me. Remember that Rosacea is a chronic condition and it can't be ""cured"". It can, however, be managed to the point of ""remission"". 


**Rosacea Wrangling Steps**


* **GO TO THE DERMATOLOGIST** - even though you might be 99% sure it's rosacea, it could be a symptom of some more serious autoimmune disorders. I actually saw an allergist earlier this year after becoming concerned my rosacea was linked to autoimmune issues. 

* **Eliminate Everything** - At one point, I felt like EVERYTHING was causing my rosacea to flare up so I took a week off from all skincare, just splashing my face with cool water when it felt to grimy. I slowly began adding products back to see what was the culprit. 

* **Identify + Manage Triggers** - My triggers are sun, heat, exercise, and cooking over a hot stove. While I can manage sun with SPF, i can't escape cooking and exercise. I manage by cooling my face off with an ice pack every 10 minutes or so while I'm cooking and spritzing my face with cool water after I work out. 

* **Build a Boring, Barrier Restoring Routine** - Say goodbye to all those cute/fancy products. Your new best friend is a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, an SPF, and the prescription from your derm. Products with niacimide, hyalauronic acid, and ceramides are generally good bets. Avoid essential oils, plant extracts, and fragrances. NO actives, no facemasks, no oils, no gels, nothing until you get the rosacea under control. 

* **Find an SPF** - Physical ONLY until your skin is under control - at that point you can try a chemical sunscreen. 

* **Add Stuff Back** - Once you have simplified your routine and rebuilt your moisture barrier, then you can start adding in new products. I recommend Melazepam azelaic acid, a good occlusive, and a hylauronic acid serum.  


**My Routine**

While my rosacea is not 100% gone, I would say it is 90% controlled. I went from having daily hot, prickly, painful flareups to maybe 1x / 2 weeks. Redness is significantly reduced but I do still look slightly pink. Pustules are well controlled, but I have some PIH. 


**AM**

* Cotz Tinted Sunscreen

* CoverFX green stick

**PM**

* Bioderma micellar water

* **HG** Vanicream sensitive cleanser

* Cerave PM (although I will most likely be changing this)

* **HG** Metrogel cream prescription - for pustules

* **HG** Melazepam Azelaic Acid - I saw almost immediate improvement using this

* Occasional Use: Stratia liquid gold (sometimes give me bumps), Cicaplast cream (ok every once in a while, but if I use it too often it irritates my skin), Afrin (I only use this if I have an event to go to and I absolutely cannot have any redness)",98,azelaic acid,ingredients,-11

I manage by cooling my face off with an ice pack every 10 minutes or so while I'm cooking and spritzing my face with cool water after I work out. 

* **Build a Boring, Barrier Restoring Routine** - Say goodbye to all those cute/fancy products. Your new best friend is a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, an SPF, and the prescription from your derm. Products with niacimide, hyalauronic acid, and ceramides are generally good bets. Avoid essential oils, plant extracts, and fragrances. NO actives, no facemasks, no oils, no gels, nothing until you get the rosacea under control. 

* **Find an SPF** - Physical ONLY until your skin is under control - at that point you can try a chemical sunscreen. 

* **Add Stuff Back** - Once you have simplified your routine and rebuilt your moisture barrier, then you can start adding in new products. I recommend Melazepam azelaic acid, a good occlusive, and a hylauronic acid serum.  


**My Routine**

While my rosacea is not 100% gone, I would say it is 90% controlled. I went from having daily hot, prickly, painful flareups to maybe 1x / 2 weeks. Redness is significantly reduced but I do still look slightly pink. Pustules are well controlled, but I have some PIH. 


**AM**

* Cotz Tinted Sunscreen

* CoverFX green stick

**PM**

* Bioderma micellar water

* **HG** Vanicream sensitive cleanser

* Cerave PM (although I will most likely be changing this)

* **HG** Metrogel cream prescription - for pustules

* **HG** Melazepam Azelaic Acid - I saw almost immediate improvement using this

* Occasional Use: Stratia liquid gold (sometimes give me bumps), Cicaplast cream (ok every once in a while, but if I use it too often it irritates my skin), Afrin (I only use this if I have an event to go to and I absolutely cannot have any redness)",98,stratia liquid gold,products,-11

Some of this advice is going to repeat things already posted but this is what worked for me. Remember that Rosacea is a chronic condition and it can't be ""cured"". It can, however, be managed to the point of ""remission"". 


**Rosacea Wrangling Steps**


* **GO TO THE DERMATOLOGIST** - even though you might be 99% sure it's rosacea, it could be a symptom of some more serious autoimmune disorders. I actually saw an allergist earlier this year after becoming concerned my rosacea was linked to autoimmune issues.

My current routine is wash my face every day with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser. Before I wash I use a toner, Clean and Clear Deep Cleaning Toner. I use CeraVe Eye Repair Cream and La Roche-Posay Rouble Repair Moisturizer.

AM:
- cleanser
- moisturizer
- sunscreen

PM:
- cleanser
- moisturizer 

Don’t incorporate all three products at the same time. Introduce them one a time and use for 1-2 weeks to confirm you don’t have any sensitivity before adding another. 

You have a cleanser (CeraVe), a retinoid, and a chemical exfoliant. Those latter two go between cleansing and moisturizing. The rule of thumb for applying products is thinnest to thickest.

Differin is a retinoid product used to treat acne and stridex is a chemical exfoliant (salicylic acid) which encourages skin turnover. Using both at the same time will likely be too harsh for your skin. I just started differin yesterday and I’m anticipating cutting out acids for the foreseeable future until my skin adjusts but you know your own skin better than anyone.

To use differin you apply a pea-sized amount or less and spread it all over your face. If you have sensitive skin, only do it every second day. Never use it more than once per day. Also, use it at night in your PM routine as it makes you more sensitive to sun.",7324,salicylic acid,ingredients,-1

- moisturizer 

Don’t incorporate all three products at the same time. Introduce them one a time and use for 1-2 weeks to confirm you don’t have any sensitivity before adding another. 

You have a cleanser (CeraVe), a retinoid, and a chemical exfoliant. Those latter two go between cleansing and moisturizing. The rule of thumb for applying products is thinnest to thickest.

Differin is a retinoid product used to treat acne and stridex is a chemical exfoliant (salicylic acid) which encourages skin turnover. Using both at the same time will likely be too harsh for your skin. I just started differin yesterday and I’m anticipating cutting out acids for the foreseeable future until my skin adjusts but you know your own skin better than anyone.

To use differin you apply a pea-sized amount or less and spread it all over your face. If you have sensitive skin, only do it every second day. Never use it more than once per day. Also, use it at night in your PM routine as it makes you more sensitive to sun.",7324,differin,products,-1

You need to use some type of cleanser or the occlusive ingredients in the moisturizers and benzoyl peroxide cream will build up on your skin.

After being a lurker for awhile and not finding exactly what I need, I decided to finally post. So currently I am prescribed adapalene after unsuccessfully trying clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide. When I used the clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide, she basically told me to trash whatever I am currently doing and just use the gel, the peroxide, and moisturize. With the adapalene gel, I was told pretty much nothing. So I have been using a basic cleanser, using the gel at night, and moisturizing. I feel like that is so basic and I don't actually know if it is hurting or helping my skin. I guess my question is, what products can/should I use with adapalene gel?",3795,benzoyl peroxide,ingredients,-5

Did Buy: Backups on Garnier micellar water. Target had a good price, plus a $5 gift card with the purchase of 3 Garnier products.
In My Stash: Just found my Restorsea Rejuvenating Day Cream, which I was treating as 'too good/$' for regular use. I love it, so I decided even if I won't replace it for $150 (I got it at a work beauty sale for $1), I deserve to enjoy it!
Reflection: My routine of a bunch of TO, oils and moisturizers is showing good anti-aging results. I'm not super tempted to buy or try anything new right now and rock the boat! 
Use It Up: L'Oréal Hydra Genius for dry skin. It works fine, nothing exciting, but it does give a glow. I'm using up the last half-inch on top of my sunblock, then I'll consider what I'll get next.

Tbh the only two things I’ll be concerned about are the actives and the argan oil.

The AHA/BHA definitely no more than once a week esp in the beginning maybe only once in ten days. You’re gonna get crazy purging in the first few months but after all the gunk is shed it’s gonna be pretty awesome.

IMO rosehip and jojoba are pretty good for acne skin but I might be more careful with the argan oil cause of the higher oleic acid content. Since you have the other oils and moisturisers to work with you may want to test the argan oil sparingly to see if it works for your skin type. If it breaks you out don’t chuck it cause argan oil is FANTASTIC for hair. I use it on my hair post-shower everyday. Moisturises without being greasy and gives great shine lol.

My two experiences with dermatologists were both bad, both for different reasons. 

The first time I was about 16. I had decent skin, but a handful of pimples. When my mom and I went in he started by looking at my moles, which is fine, but when I asked him about my acne he said it's normal. I asked him what I could do and he told me he could put me on ACCUTANE. For a girl with maybe 6 pimples. I said no, and he told me to wash my face with Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash (the super drying orange gel of awfulness) and dont use anything else to dry out my oily skin. So started my journey from decent skin, to terrible skin. For the next 8 or so years until I found this sub I had skin that was painful. Insanely dehydrated and even more acne.

Fast forward to second go around. I had better skin after finding this sub but still had issues, and hadn't been sticking to a routine. I went into a different derm. I booked the appointment with 2 concerns: acne and itchy legs. She looked at my legs, prescribed me a lotion for them, and went to leave. I said wait what about my facial skin concerns? She said I could use that lotion on my face for acne. I asked if I could tell her my current routine. She hasn't heard of the vast majority of brand's I mentioned (all very popular sephora/ulta/drugstore brands) but said I could also use both benzoyl peroxide and differen. I asked if she had a moisturizer recommendation. She told me it wasn't necessary (!) and if I wanted to use whatever I used in my body.

This isn't just skincare enthusiasts acting like they know more than derms, this is dangerous advice. I of course used differen and benzoyl without moisturizer and proceeded to give myself painful chemical burns.

I believe both of these derms thought this level of skincare below their purview and not worth delving into, and I believe most derms are far more medical centered and not really a good route for those of us without severe acne.",930,benzoyl peroxide,ingredients,-17

I have always had redness on my cheeks and chin, and only recently started having very subtle acne-type skin-colored bumps on my cheeks. Since then, I have managed to get it completely under control both with and without prescriptions. I recently wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8gjqzb/misc_if_you_think_you_may_have_even_mild_rosacea/?st=jgwex83u&sh=f28359a8) summarizing the advice I received and what has worked for me. In summary:

&nbsp;


- First and foremost, if possible, **see a dermatologist** to get a proper diagnosis and likely a prescription for an antibiotic (e.g., doxycycline), a sulfur face wash (i.e., sulfacleanse), or a topical cream.  
- All rosacea types are different and need to be treated in different ways. However, when in doubt, stick with a routine that is tailored towards [sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/sensitive-skin/how-sensitizing-ingredients-hurt-skin.html?fdid=sensitive-skin) (i.e., try to avoid harsh cleansers, hot water, essential oils, fragrance, physical exfoliators, etc.)
- **Chemical sunscreen** is a major irritant for rosacea patients and can cause not only redness but also papules (which may look like skin-colored closed comedones, or red acne-like bumps)
- **Moisturizer** is extremely important whether you have dry or oil skin. I have seen unbelievable results with [Vanicream](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiYld7q-fPaAhWKiMgKHX9LBMMYABAHGgJxdQ&sig=AOD64_0VmHQkGXGAh1JCJpVsuoWZyBaQlQ&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwibiNXq-fPaAhVSGt8KHYyCCuEQ9aACegQIABBK&adurl=), [La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baum AP+](https://www.laroche-posay.us/lipikar-balm-ap--3337872418570.html), and [Neturogena Hydro Boost Extra Dry](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjG2NT3-fPaAhWHnrMKHRj2D0IYABAKGgJxbg&sig=AOD64_0skvbGTy7r9RWVtvX4Ajs_Cc3MqQ&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwiIs8r3-fPaAhUBhOAKHd2HB80Q9aACegQIABBQ&adurl=). CeraVe PM was also recommended to me by my doctor.
- Always use **SPF**.
- **Chemical exfoliators (i.e., AHA/BHAs)** are not *always* the devil. As always, YMMV, but I have been using AHAs and BHAs (pretty strong) for years and have had many conversations with my dermatologist about my use of chemical exfoliants and other actives. As long as you take it extremely slow to start and are not noticing any worsening symptoms (i.e., extra redness or papules), then it is completely fine to keep using these products with caution. I lessened by use of these products but am still getting great results with texture, brightness, skin-tone, etc.

&nbsp;

For those interested: Here's a picture of [before and after](https://imgur.com/a/aAm9OiP) I changed up my routine.
 

While taken in very different lighting, this shows the major improvement I saw after taking my dermatologists advice and before my prescriptions arrived (about 5 days). It is actually even better now. (Note: I have some moles on my face, so the bump next to my nose and on my chin are moles and not papules.)",91,aha,ingredients,1

I recently wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8gjqzb/misc_if_you_think_you_may_have_even_mild_rosacea/?st=jgwex83u&sh=f28359a8) summarizing the advice I received and what has worked for me. In summary:

&nbsp;


- First and foremost, if possible, **see a dermatologist** to get a proper diagnosis and likely a prescription for an antibiotic (e.g., doxycycline), a sulfur face wash (i.e., sulfacleanse), or a topical cream.  
- All rosacea types are different and need to be treated in different ways. However, when in doubt, stick with a routine that is tailored towards [sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/sensitive-skin/how-sensitizing-ingredients-hurt-skin.html?fdid=sensitive-skin) (i.e., try to avoid harsh cleansers, hot water, essential oils, fragrance, physical exfoliators, etc.)
- **Chemical sunscreen** is a major irritant for rosacea patients and can cause not only redness but also papules (which may look like skin-colored closed comedones, or red acne-like bumps)
- **Moisturizer** is extremely important whether you have dry or oil skin. I have seen unbelievable results with [Vanicream](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiYld7q-fPaAhWKiMgKHX9LBMMYABAHGgJxdQ&sig=AOD64_0VmHQkGXGAh1JCJpVsuoWZyBaQlQ&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwibiNXq-fPaAhVSGt8KHYyCCuEQ9aACegQIABBK&adurl=), [La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baum AP+](https://www.laroche-posay.us/lipikar-balm-ap--3337872418570.html), and [Neturogena Hydro Boost Extra Dry](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjG2NT3-fPaAhWHnrMKHRj2D0IYABAKGgJxbg&sig=AOD64_0skvbGTy7r9RWVtvX4Ajs_Cc3MqQ&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwiIs8r3-fPaAhUBhOAKHd2HB80Q9aACegQIABBQ&adurl=). CeraVe PM was also recommended to me by my doctor.
- Always use **SPF**.
- **Chemical exfoliators (i.e., AHA/BHAs)** are not *always* the devil. As always, YMMV, but I have been using AHAs and BHAs (pretty strong) for years and have had many conversations with my dermatologist about my use of chemical exfoliants and other actives. As long as you take it extremely slow to start and are not noticing any worsening symptoms (i.e., extra redness or papules), then it is completely fine to keep using these products with caution. I lessened by use of these products but am still getting great results with texture, brightness, skin-tone, etc.

# Bottom shelf
- **Pixi Glow Tonic 5% Glycolic Toner** - ♦♦♦ OR ♦♦♦♦ - I have been using this since I started developing a skincare routine, but I wouldn't say it's HG because I don't see major benefits like some other products. I use it for toning and like the added low concentration of glycolic in the AM. (Will repurchase, again)
- **Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - One of several DE products I tested, spent a year (and $$) searching for substitutions, and returned to. This one has lighted my dark spots, evened my skin tone, and brightened my face very visibly. (Will repurchase, again)
- **Stratia Liquid Gold** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - HG hydrating product with the addition of ceramides that I wasn't getting elsewhere. My skin drinks this up and I especially love using it after I use strong actives. (Will repurchase)
- **Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - If I had to pick just one AHA/BHA product, it would be this. Great blend of the two and my texture, SFs, and even dryness/redness are taken care of. 
- **Drunk Elephant B-Hydra** - ♦♦♦ - Good product but not sure that it has changed my skin much. I mix it in with C-Firma or an oil for added hydration. 
- **Neutrogena Hydro Boost for Extra Dry Skin** - ♦♦♦♦ - A great gel moisturizer recommended by ScA and then my derm, so I had to try it. I use this mostly in the AM. 
- **Stridex in the red box** - ♦♦♦♦ - Since I have dry skin, I use this when I have SFs or when I do the SPK technique. Always see great results, but it dries me out if I use it regularly. 
- **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream** - Unrated - Can't rate this one yet because it's new and I have only used in twice in combination with other moisturizers. Can report back. 
- **EltaMD UV Elements SPF 44, tinted** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - I can't use chemical sunscreens, so this was a derm rec. Amazing product and the tint is perfect for me. (Will repurchase)

# Second shelf from bottom
- **Hora Skincare CBD Serum** - ♦♦ - The ingredients are promising, but minimal results. (Will not repurchase)
- **Ole Henriksen Truth Serum** - ♦♦♦ - I like the smell, consistency, and make up of this product for a low concentration vitamin C, but it wasn't enough for me. (Will not repurchase)
- **Timeless Vitamin C Serum** - ♦♦♦ - I may not have given this one enough time, but I didn't see results like I did with the C-Firma. (Likely will not repurchase)
- **The Ordinary ALL PRODUCTS IN ONE REVIEW** - Azelaic Acid has done wonders for me, will be getting it in my Curology next month. Others I won’t repurchase.
- **Drunk Elephant TLC Sukari Babyfacial** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - This really is a facial in a bottle. I think I am more beautiful after I use this than I was before - every damn time. (Will repurchase again)
- **Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Moisturizer AND Protini Peptide Cream** - ♦♦♦♦ - Both are very nice creams, different textures for AM and PM, but not necessary for me with other amazing inexpensive moisturizers.

# Second shelf from top

I use almost nothing from this shelf anymore, but I can review…

- **Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Oil** - ♦♦ - I don't think oils (without the extra benefits a la Sunday Riley) should be that expensive. (Will not repurchase)
- **Acure Seriously Glowing Facial Serum** - ♦♦♦♦ - ...which is an oil not a serum. Great blend of oils, very hydrating, sinks in nicely. (Will repurchase.)

# Top shelf
- **Ole Henriksen Hygge HydraClay Detox Mask** - ♦♦♦ - Good product, but there are cheaper options.
- **Biore UV Face Milk AND Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50** - ♦ - YMMV, but these dried me out like crazy.
- **Dr Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Cream** - ♦♦♦ - More like makeup than skincare.
- **Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb** - ♦♦♦♦ - Love, but not necessary with Hydro Boost.
- **Curology (Tret 0.012%, Niacinamide 4%, Vitamin C 5%)** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - Got this for the tretinoin (anti-aging, not acne), and thank goodness I did.
- **Differin Gel** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - A good alternative to tretinoin. 
- **Clean and Clear Benzoyl Peroxide** - ♦♦♦♦ - Run of the mill spot treatment for the occasional pimple.

#Not pictured
- **Vanicream AND La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - Holy Grail heavy moisturizing creams. Both are great for sensitive skin and are extremely moisturizing. I could bathe in them.

# Bottom shelf
- **Pixi Glow Tonic 5% Glycolic Toner** - ♦♦♦ OR ♦♦♦♦ - I have been using this since I started developing a skincare routine, but I wouldn't say it's HG because I don't see major benefits like some other products. I use it for toning and like the added low concentration of glycolic in the AM. (Will repurchase, again)
- **Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - One of several DE products I tested, spent a year (and $$) searching for substitutions, and returned to. This one has lighted my dark spots, evened my skin tone, and brightened my face very visibly. (Will repurchase, again)
- **Stratia Liquid Gold** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - HG hydrating product with the addition of ceramides that I wasn't getting elsewhere. My skin drinks this up and I especially love using it after I use strong actives. (Will repurchase)
- **Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - If I had to pick just one AHA/BHA product, it would be this. Great blend of the two and my texture, SFs, and even dryness/redness are taken care of. 
- **Drunk Elephant B-Hydra** - ♦♦♦ - Good product but not sure that it has changed my skin much. I mix it in with C-Firma or an oil for added hydration. 
- **Neutrogena Hydro Boost for Extra Dry Skin** - ♦♦♦♦ - A great gel moisturizer recommended by ScA and then my derm, so I had to try it. I use this mostly in the AM. 
- **Stridex in the red box** - ♦♦♦♦ - Since I have dry skin, I use this when I have SFs or when I do the SPK technique. Always see great results, but it dries me out if I use it regularly. 
- **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream** - Unrated - Can't rate this one yet because it's new and I have only used in twice in combination with other moisturizers. Can report back. 
- **EltaMD UV Elements SPF 44, tinted** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - I can't use chemical sunscreens, so this was a derm rec. Amazing product and the tint is perfect for me. (Will repurchase)

# Second shelf from bottom
- **Hora Skincare CBD Serum** - ♦♦ - The ingredients are promising, but minimal results. (Will not repurchase)
- **Ole Henriksen Truth Serum** - ♦♦♦ - I like the smell, consistency, and make up of this product for a low concentration vitamin C, but it wasn't enough for me. (Will not repurchase)
- **Timeless Vitamin C Serum** - ♦♦♦ - I may not have given this one enough time, but I didn't see results like I did with the C-Firma. (Likely will not repurchase)
- **The Ordinary ALL PRODUCTS IN ONE REVIEW** - Azelaic Acid has done wonders for me, will be getting it in my Curology next month. Others I won’t repurchase.
- **Drunk Elephant TLC Sukari Babyfacial** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - This really is a facial in a bottle. I think I am more beautiful after I use this than I was before - every damn time. (Will repurchase again)
- **Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Moisturizer AND Protini Peptide Cream** - ♦♦♦♦ - Both are very nice creams, different textures for AM and PM, but not necessary for me with other amazing inexpensive moisturizers.

I use almost nothing from this shelf anymore, but I can review…

- **Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Oil** - ♦♦ - I don't think oils (without the extra benefits a la Sunday Riley) should be that expensive. (Will not repurchase)
- **Acure Seriously Glowing Facial Serum** - ♦♦♦♦ - ...which is an oil not a serum. Great blend of oils, very hydrating, sinks in nicely. (Will repurchase.)

# Top shelf
- **Ole Henriksen Hygge HydraClay Detox Mask** - ♦♦♦ - Good product, but there are cheaper options.
- **Biore UV Face Milk AND Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50** - ♦ - YMMV, but these dried me out like crazy.
- **Dr Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Cream** - ♦♦♦ - More like makeup than skincare.
- **Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb** - ♦♦♦♦ - Love, but not necessary with Hydro Boost.
- **Curology (Tret 0.012%, Niacinamide 4%, Vitamin C 5%)** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - Got this for the tretinoin (anti-aging, not acne), and thank goodness I did.
- **Differin Gel** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - A good alternative to tretinoin. 
- **Clean and Clear Benzoyl Peroxide** - ♦♦♦♦ - Run of the mill spot treatment for the occasional pimple.

#Not pictured
- **Vanicream AND La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+** - ♦♦♦♦♦ - Holy Grail heavy moisturizing creams. Both are great for sensitive skin and are extremely moisturizing. I could bathe in them.
- **Laneige Water Sleeping Mask AND Lip Mask** - Lip mask is the most HOLY GRAIL lip product ever. Haven't seen chapped lips in months. The sleeping mask is the best hydrating mask I've seen, sinks in pretty quickly though.",1315,tretinoin,ingredients,16

I know it is fungal because in the past I used a prescription fungal cream and it cleared up the bumps. 

For me personally, the fungal acne is not itchy at all. I have tiny little bumps scattered across my forehead. They can be scratched off sometimes, and if picked at they contain a white 'plug'. I rarely get inflammatory acne on my forehead. The bumps can literally appear overnight, especially if triggered. Iv noticed if I don't wash my face for a long period of time, or sweat at night while asleep, this can cause the FA to worsen. 

Products i'v tried: Nizoral 2% (seems to kind of work?), random OTC antifungal creams (usually they contain menthol or other crap I don't want on my skin so I end up not using), and De La Cruz Sulfur (currently using, seems to be working, but honestly the smell kind of sucks). 

Products that DON'T work: Salicylic acid. I'v tried many different SA products in the past and have found they really don't do much for my skin.

And as far as treatments go, lightest to heaviest is a good rule of thumb. Try to leave some time in between all those treatments if you can. The products you listed are good for helping hyper-pigmentation/scarring, and the BHA should help your acne if your skin responds well to it. Just please be careful adding them all at once, if something goes wrong you won’t be able to pinpoint which product your skin is responding badly to. And patch test to make sure they’re friendly with your skin. Otherwise looks good as far as order. A lot of the time there isn’t a completely “right” order, just thinnest to thickest and whatever feels good for you personally.  Make sure your moisturizer is good enough because your skin may be get dehydrated with the combination of new actives. Hope any of this was helpful! ",7738,bha,products,-1

the next and more important point: please please only use differin once a day. the leaflet that comes in the packaging states that more frequent use does not deliver faster/better results, but will increase irritation and sensitivity. your skin sounds fried and very stressed from overtreatment - i'd strip your routine to bare bones and prioritize moisturization above all for the time being. when your skin has calmed down, slowly reintroduce the differin, maybe once every other night or every few nights.",2150,differin,products,2

I vaguely remember posts in this sub from about an year or two back of how sometimes a good skincare routine or AB can be just as effective as botox or something more drastic. So I guess I want to ask what I can incorporate into my routine \(which is not the best anyway\). 

\-\-\-

**Skin type**: Probably balanced and mostly alright. I get occasional pimples from \(I suspect\) not eating right or stress or hormone changes. I'm also a bit of a picker when I'm stressed.

**Current routine**: As minimal as I can possibly make it, and I really suck about wearing sunscreen. :\(

*Morning:* CeraVe baby wash and CeraVe AM or PM moisturizer \(it usually ends up being PM, sorry\)

*Evening:* a quick rinse with water, if anything.

*Occasionally:* a mineral oil cleanse \(I feel like this really helps get the gunk out of my pores and also tackles any dry spots.\)

So I guess I want to ask what I can incorporate into my routine \(which is not the best anyway\).

**Skin type**: Probably balanced and mostly alright. I get occasional pimples from \(I suspect\) not eating right or stress or hormone changes. I'm also a bit of a picker when I'm stressed.

**Current routine**: As minimal as I can possibly make it, and I really suck about wearing sunscreen. :\(

*Morning:* CeraVe baby wash and CeraVe AM or PM moisturizer \(it usually ends up being PM, sorry\)

*Evening:* a quick rinse with water, if anything.

*Occasionally:* a mineral oil cleanse \(I feel like this really helps get the gunk out of my pores and also tackles any dry spots.\)

I had started to get small bumps that would come and go on my nose, and it was sometimes inflamed.  She said she didn't think it was rosacea, but rosacea-like, and prescribed retin-a and something else.  It was so long ago I don't remember.  Shortly after I went on the pill for ovarian cysts, and boom, my skin got better.

Fast forward some years, I went off the pill, and just as I knew would happen, the pustules came back, but it was quite manageable.  However, I saw a pic of me without makeup on, and wow, I didn't realize how red I was in the center of my face.  I knew, but didn't think it was that bad.  Forgiving bathroom lighting, I suppose.

So I made an appointment with a new derm for a skin check and she noticed that I have broken capillaries  on my nose (I've had them for years, but they've gotten worse) and said that I had mild rosacea and that we need to control it before it gets worse.  Obviously I'm sad that it wasn't properly diagnosed years ago.  She prescribed finacea in the evening (love it, seems to help with inflammation) and metrogel (have just started using this consistently and I think it's helping with this last bout of small pustules) in the morning.  She also prescribed sulfacleanse, which I think is quite drying, so I only use it some mornings. The thing that's difficult is that the bumps come and go inconsistently.  One month I get them, one month I don't.  A couple months ago instead of small bumps on my nose, I got a good size pimple on my cheek right next to my nose.  

I still use chemical exfoliants at night (TO AHA/BHA once a week, TO retinoid at night) which don't irritate me at all.  i use vitamin C every morning.

The capillaries have bothered me for a while, but never enough to do anything about it.  But now that I've seen that picture....I'm really bothered.  I'm going to do a series of four combination laser treatments to hopefully get rid of them and even out my skin tone.  This should take care of a few larger sun spots i have as well.

For the last few months I've been a daily sunscreen user, I've used both chemical and physical with no issue.

While the topicals have been good, i think in the end the best thing for me to do is go back on the pill.",111,aha,ingredients,-9

Second, I figured out what type of acne I have so I could treat the underlying cause. Third, I figured out my skin type. Your skin type might effect how you treat your acne. 
My routine (for dry, acne prone skin): First Aid Beauty cleanser (it's frangrance free, like all FAB products, which is great for acne prone skin), FAB radiance pads (toner that gently exfoliates the skin), Clinique Acne Solutions All Over Clearing Treatment (contains benzoyl peroxide which kills acne causing bacteria), *wait 5-15 minutes,* Juice Beauty Clearing Serum (contains salicylic acid which also exfoliates), *wait another 5-15 minutes to let acne products FULLY absorb,* FAB hydrating serum, Biossance mositurizer, and FAB 5 in 1 SPF. At night I double cleanse with Origins Modern Friction and use FAB ultra repair cream instead of SPF.
Okay, I know that is a lot. The thing that I think has improved my skin the most is combining salicylic acid with benzoyl peroxide.

**Whats** **In** **My** **Stash**

In line for patch testing: 

- apieu madecassoside cream

- Stratia Soft Touch AHA

- Dr Jart Ceramidin Liquid

Backups:

- Heimish All Clean Balm: I have approximately two days left on my current first cleanse (grapeseed oil) and then I'm starting this.  

- Aromatica Rose Absolute First Serum: I used it this winter and didn't notice a difference until I stopped.  I finally re ordered in march but the shipment was delayed and it didn't come until the end of April so I bought Whamisa Green Tea Serum for the interim, I have about two weeks left before I can open the Aromatica

- too many samples, I was really good at getting through them but wondering if my stubborn spots are fungal is making me wary to use anything but the necessities until I figure it out.  

**Reflection**
Unfortunately non of my products are on the FA safe lists, I still need to go through their ingredients, but either way I'm going to use them up because even if I do have a bit of the FA it's not that bad.  I am going to destash my sheet masks (~5 of them) because the bumps / irritation that follows is what made me suspect FA in the first place.  Thankfully my stash isn't bad and my routine isn't super complicated, but I'm still really looking forward to the 'only having what I use' phase which is helping to keep shopping in check.  I just got into skincare last October so I'm still working through products from the initial trial and error period.  

**Use** **It** **Up**

- grapeseed oil : finishing in the next ~2 days

- skin.goo rosewater micellar : this bottle is just WAY too big for an occasional micellar user like myself.  I'm about 1/2 way there.  

- things I stopped to determine fatty alchohol sensitivity and need to add back on to see if they all do it or just a few (but I'm scared!): Stratia Liquid Gold, La Roche Posay Double Repair Moisturizer

- TO Caffine : this is the last full size thing in my eye care stash that I need to use up, there's still one sample after this and then I'm done! & not replacing! 

- also I just need to get in the dang habit of using my Vitamin C. I'm not trying to get through it or anything, I just never remember to use it regularly enough to see effects.

I tested it on 1/2 my face for two weeks before progressing to full face.  Recently the skin around my cheekbone / jaw feels sensitized after patting it in, typically it takes a few seconds & it goes away as soon as I move on to my next step but I have noticed that area being a bit flush afterwards, which also goes away.  

I can't find any actives in it, I'm not typically sensitive to plant extracts / fragrance, and none of my other products have this affect.  The only thing I've really noticed negative effects from is fatty alchohols.

Up until now I've really liked it, I do two thin layers before my moisturizer and feel like it adds hydration / is initially soothing, and since I've started using it I feel glowier.   I don't particularly want to stop using it but I'm also concerned about whether or not this is normal, so if anyone has insight I'd love to hear!

For reference:  I'm in my early 30s,  my skin is dehydrated, somewhat reactive (but usually in the form of cysts, not like this), and I'm in a warm, humid climate (southeast, US).

With hay fever season upon us in the U.K., I’ve been protecting myself from rashes with the Daily Anti Redness Solution. So far so good - no irritating red patches from pollen and pollution!

Like other commenters have mentioned, it's difficult to make specific product recommendations without knowing your skin type/how it responds to things, plus you don't want to be overwhelmed off the bat with an elaborate routine.

Bare basics: moisturize morning and evening, and make sunscreen your new BFF. When I can't/won't do much, I cleanse my face with the pink-cap garnier micellar water before moisturizer.

Also, not exactly routine related, but super important- stay hydrated!! some skin problems relate to being dehydrated and there's no need to go crazy with products when water will help. I drink a ton of unsweetened ginseng or mint tea and it's really helped me. 

Good luck!",1093,garnier micellar water,products,14

They look more like tear troughs. I'm not an expert on the subject, but that's my guess because tear troughs aren't uncommon in young people/teens, while eyebags are much less common.

If they are troughs, they're genetic. You can't do much more than moisturize, use reflecting/lightening makeup, and have healthy sleep/eating habits. This is because this is a bone structure problem, not much of a skin problem. The already thin skin over your eyes is stretched thin which gives you the eye hollow look, basically. The bone structure of your face cases shadows which causes those dark circle appearances.

Could always get expensive ""fillers"" at your local dermatologist but the results are temporary. I have really deepset eyes and dark tear troughs at 19, if it makes you feel any better. Yours are hardly noticable in comparison.

Spironolactone if female

Accutane/doxycycline for either gender

This is usually how it goes. I'm female and on Doxycycline and birth control for hormonal and cystic acne along with my routine. You need to fix your hormones before doing anything else, which is why the dermatologist said you'd likely outgrow it. Outgrowing and letting your hormones settle is usually the fix.

Having a consistent and gentle routine will help, but hormonal and cystic acne are internally caused which topicals and ointments rarely fix forever. Topicals won't hurt, though, and they can prevent most of the other hormonal acne from popping up or reduce their severity when they do. So I'd say try them along with your usual routine. Aczone helped me a bit even if I breakout still.

It all depends on the severity of your acne. Doxycycline and other oral medicines have adverse side effects which is probably why you weren't prescribed some if your acne isn't as severe, particularly accutane. I think for you the best you can do is maintain a simple routine and eat healthily like you said. Most guys outgrow their acne.

I live in Switzerland so hopefully you can find some of the same products where you live, here's my routine:

I don't wash my face in the morning, I do it at night and try to wash my pillowcase often.

- Melvita's Orange Blossom Eau Extraordinaire

- Phytorelax Bio Oat and Hyaluronic acid Serum

- Mosqueta's Velvet Cream Moisturzer

The moisturizer may be too heavy for your portuguese weather though. I still definitely recommend the first two products, both for your skin tone/complexion and for the tiny bumps. They are not even aimed at tiny-bump-skin but that di go away when I started using them.

Red clay masks are great when I feel I need to cleanse my skin more deeply, and a honey+matcha mask is my go-to DIY mix for those times when I want the extra glow...

Hope your skin gets better!

My acne cleared in like a year. But I'd say products go a long way in helping.

I think you should keep in mind:

1. Exfoliate. Chemical, not physical, because physical exfoliators only irritated me during that time. I use physical exfoliators now though.

2. You NEED to moisturise your skin and keep it hydrated. I made the mistake of not having enough hydration and it was NOT fun. Try a sleeping pack if your moisturise doesn't seem heavy/occlusive enough.

3. If you're worried about the dark spots, try adding niacinamide into your routine, before moisturiser and after exfoliating. Of course, make sure your skin likes niacinamide first.",749,niacinamide,ingredients,-3

Many here always suggest eye creams/lotions etc are useless and a gimmick for skincare companies to sell more stuff, because the ingredients in the face cream are the same/almost the same as in the eye cream.

I very much disagree with that mentality, because, not only is the skin around the immediate area of your eyes a lot thinner compared to the skin on your face, but also the ingredients, be they the same or almost the same as the face cream, are usually in other quantities and formulations. 

Anyway, so far I’ve used 2 eye treatments with retinol, the first was Olay, but I didn’t see much improvement. 
The one I’m using now is the La Roche Posay Redermic R for eyes, and i love it, it’s moisturising too, but not too heavy, especially great for under make up as it’s not greasy, and it’s also not overly expensive either.

Firstly, stir away from heavy eye creams, you could easily end up up keratin buildup in that area, and it’s a bitch to get rid of. 

Secondly, fine lines always seem to disappear when I hydrate my eyes properly, but with something light. My eyes love the Fresh lotus eye gel or the Omorovicza eye lotion. They both have cucumber and they both have that lovely yet subtle fresh smell of it too. 

Both the hydration, extra sleep, I’ve quit smoking and cut down coffee to 1 a day, have significantly reduced my dark circles under my eyes and the fine lines. 

If we’re talking fine lines that are bordering on wrinkles, I’m using the La Roche Posay Redermic R eyes, it has retinol which helps with wrinkles, but it’s a very light cream, my eyes love it. 

I’ve got the Caudalie Premier Cru eyes also, it’s nice so far, but I’ve only been using it at night and not for long enough to give you an honest opinion. 

Anyway, if you just want to choose between the two you’ve listed, I’d go with Tatcha.

Literally. From my cheeks down to my individual toes. I’ve also been doing it for roughly 7 years (on my face at least)! So hopefully I am well versed enough to talk about this. 

Laser was the most efficient semi-permanent hair removal I’ve ever had done. My leg hair used to be so incredibly thick that I would get ingrown hairs every time I waxed or epilated—my follicles were gigantic and visible to the naked eye from how much the thick hairs stretched them. My skin colour is medium-light, I’m an NC25-30 in mac I think, so not super pale but not dark either. My hairs were all black and I had lots of arm hair which was thin and long, super thick underarm, leg, abdomen and lower back (the thickest was my lower back) hair, and laser was incredibly effective everywhere, reducing hair in most places to almost nothing (for example, I have to shave my underarms every 3 months maybe). Except for my face and upper arms where it made it thicker (I was warned about this by the laser specialists before starting but did it anyways because I suck). Apparently the growth in these areas is driven by hormones, so a change in hormones or acting on the hairs with laser could alter their growth negatively. I don’t know if this information is concrete; but anecdotally, this applied to me. 
I’d say that it really is effective! I believe my hormones changed last year since I started getting acne out of nowhere after having clear skin my entire life—the effects of laser didn’t go away in light of this (thank God) so hopefully that means there is little correlation! YMMV though. Good luck! ",7447,tret,ingredients,-2

Everything! I'm on no buy for two weeks, and this time I MEAN IT.

**What's In My Stash:**


Currently 85 items lol. I have an obsessively updated spreadsheet, so I can keep tabs on myself. 85 sounds like a lot, but that includes 20 sheet masks, as well as duplicates (backups). It's nice to review when I'm feeling really tempted to buy a new thing. Like, I have three full sized gel creams, I do not need another one until I'm almost out of the second tub! Also worth noting that my count was at 100 on March 31st. I'm working through samples, since that's an easy way to reduce, as well as sheet masking more often.

There's also three items that I'm currently talking myself into just throwing away because they are either ineffective but cute, or that I hate, and they are nothing worth trying to sell or even give away.

**Reflection:**


Overall I've made great progress, and I'm generally happy. There's absolutely things I need to work on, but most of my products make me happy, and I'm satisfied. 

Two weeks ago I started having a major allergic reaction, full face of hives stretching down my neck, and last week on Monday, my eyes swelled shut. I had to stop almost all products and see the doctor, resulting in a regime of Benadryl, Zyrtec, and an emergency supply of steroids just in case. I THINK it was triggered by a heavy use of Rosehip oil, which I was ironically using to reset my routine to address a breakout. I dumped that bitch.

The last month has been a comedy of errors, starting with burning my face with a mud mask containing spearmint, having a breakout from sunscreen, and then the allergic reaction. I'm back to moderate normalcy, and have an appointment for allergy tests.

**Use It Up:**


I'm focusing on samples and smaller things, like my Etude House Soon Jungle Barrier Repair Cream, which I really like, but I have a tube of Vanicream in my mailbox to test and hopefully use next. I need to focus on my Mizon Water Gel EX and get through the tub before moving on, but I'm getting really attached to my Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel, and using both is going to make it slow going for empties.

The effectiveness of those peels actually lies in the glycolic acid (AHA) and salicytic acid (BHA).  Some of the additional ingredients are beneficial, but the 4 listed above are really not, especially not in a peeling product.  It's considered a harsh product, with very few benefits.  

In addition, the product is formulated at a pH of 4.4, which renders the acids (AHA and BHAs) close to ineffective.  When it comes to peel products, the lower the pH, the more effective, and each numerical pH reduction, increases the potency of the peel by a factor of 10, so a peel formulated with a pH of 3 is 10 times more effective than a peel formulated with a pH of 4.  

For a more lovely, gentler, kinder, and more effective ""dupe"" Drunk Elephant's Babyfacial is a far better choice.  Lower Ph, (I think around 3.5), no harmful ingredients, cruelty free and well loved by all the beauty gurus, almost everywhere.

Not my personal favorite, but I'd take it over the Dr. Dennis Gross pads, any day.

For a far more cost effective ""dupe"" I recommend you try ""The Ordinary's"" AHA and BHA peel, which contains  30% glycolic acid + 2% salicytic acid + all of the other beneficial acids that are in the Dr. Dennis Gross pads, with none of the harmful ones, plus a much more effective, low pH of 3.6, and it only costs $7.90!

Before the founder does something even more insane, if that's even possible.)   You can also buy it on Amazon, but they charge a couple bucks more for it there.  

I'm more experienced with peels however, and use a FAR more effective product -- Revitaboost peel pads, 30 pads, for 30 peels, for $29.95 on Amazon.  Formulated at a pH around 1, it is far, far more potent, but not that bad either.  15% glycolic acid +15% TCA + 3 Mandelic acid, it is capable of penetrating far deeper into your skin, and if you leave it on long enough, can result in a gentle peel, and do far more to improve the texture of your skin.

[Product Question] I ~accidentally~ left my Melano CC serum in the car for a few hours. Does that affect anything?,1,1,0,8i6mzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8i6mzo/product_question_i_accidentally_left_my_melano_cc/,Saga_I_Sig,"Is the texture still the same? Often with creams and gels you can tell if they've been damaged by the heat if they suddenly liquify and are less solid than usual.

I lived in a house in Japan with no air conditioning that was often above 100 inside during the summer. I only had a product go bad once after months of those temperatures, and I could tell because my cream was suddenly a liquid. But generally, I don't think a few hours will ruin most products. It's more of an issue when it's frequently kept at high temps over several days-weeks.

I also had one Benton product go bad during shipping (1 month on a boat from Korea in July), but that was because the brand used weak ""natural"" preservatives. AFAIK Melano preservatives are generally stable and strong enough to withstand heat.

And vitamin c derivatives (MAP/SAP) as in Melano CC are much more stable than l-ascorbic vitamin c, so you shouldn't have to be concerned with it browning or losing efficacy as with l-ascorbic acid serums. Since it looks fine, it should be OK.

If you're worried, maybe try spot-testing it just to be sure.",2679,vitamin c,ingredients,-15

[misc] What are your favorite Japanese skincare products?,2,3,0,8hrdhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hrdhl/misc_what_are_your_favorite_japanese_skincare/,Saga_I_Sig,"I lived in Japan for a couple years. In my experience, moisturizers don't often come with SPF in them. You're better off buying hydrating/moisturizing products separately, and then also buying separate sunscreen. Of course, some sunscreens are more moisturizing/less drying than others, so keep an eye out for words like ""moist"", ""ageing care"" or ""rich"". Do some googling to find some specific sunscreens that are moisturizing - there are a ton of reviews out there that talk about it.

[This article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/reviews/my-top-5-japanese-sunscreens-for-2017/) mentions some of my favorite sunscreens. I personally like Skin Aqua and Nivea the best. Also try some of their SPF 50+ PA++++ spray-on sunscreens - they're super convenient. Just grab a bunch of varieties at the drugstore if you see them.

Honestly, sunscreen is probably the best thing to stock up on because that's what's hardest/most expensive to get in the US. 

Most of my favorite hydrating/moisturizing products can be bought very inexpensively in the US (if that's where you live) on Amazon. I like Rosette Ceramide Gel, Cezanne High Moist, Hada Labo Shirojyun Lotion, Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel, etc.

There are of course higher end products that are harder to find here, but I've found that Japanese drugstore products work pretty much as well as the expensive things. Maybe try Tunemakers if you can find it, or Matsuyama brand green tea products? Look at Razilla Cosme and on the r/asianbeauty and r/asianbeautyadvice subs for past discussions of HGs, favorite products, etc. You can find past threads bookmarked in the sidebar sometimes, or just by using Google to search. (The Reddit search function is awful for searching those subs).

One thing related that I'll recommend is some really nice high-quality washcloths and face towels - I find them much better than anything I've seen outside of Japan. Imabari Towels is the (imo) best and most famous brand in Japan, and they're carried at Takashimaya.

Another thing to stock up on may be UPF (sun-protective) clothing and accessories. Japan has *amazing* UPF gloves, jackets, hats and parasols that are fantastically effective at blocking the sun and super cute, too. Look for the phrases ""sun-cut"" or ""UV-cut"" as those're their term for something being sun protective.

Again, look at department stores for the best selection. If you go to a Uniqlo (and you should!) they also have a nice, inexpensive ultra-lightweight selection of UPF 30 jackets and other clothing that I wear all summer long.

As for a cleanser, most cleansers in Japan are gentle by default. Look for cleansing milks, whips or gels and avoid foaming cleansers. Shiseido Perfect Whip is extremely popular. Popular drugstore options are Hada Labo Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Cezanne Skin Care Wash, and Sana Nameraka Honpo Cleansing Milk.

Going on accutane was the best decision I’ve ever made and I can’t even explain what it feels like to have confidence again. My tears of pain have turned into tears of joy and I am happy again. Oh boy, I’ve waited to be happy for so long and it feels so good. 
I still have very textured skin and hyperpigmentation but I’m so grateful I don’t even care, with time and patience I can fix it !!! Thank you for reading and thank you for being here for me in my darkest time. SCA and the accutane community kept me going when no one else could. Thank you guys, truly.

My routine (all thanks to you guys): 

AM: 
-Tone with Thayers rose witch hazel 
-Moisturize using CeraVe AM moisturizer 

PM:
-Oil cleanse method: organic hemp oil and CeraVe foaming face wash
-Cosrx snail mucin essence 
-jojoba oil as my nighttime moisturizer 
-aquaphor as an occlusive 

Post accutane PM routine:
I now use RetinA every night after oil cleansing and have changed my nighttime moisturizer from jojoba oil to CeraVe in the tub. (Still use Cosrx snail mucin and aquaphor as an occlusive)”",4585,cosrx snail mucin essence,products,-13

[B&A] Progress and Acne Scars,28,1,0,8hrqqk,https://m.imgur.com/a/K7g0gM0,scarella1,"Hey everyone! The first 2 pictures are from January 2018 and the last 2 are current (May 2018). My skin broke out last fall/winter. Currently, my skin is 90% just scarring. 

Skin type: oily/combo, with my t-zone super oily a few hours after washing, but also can get dry and flaky on chin and above mouth when irritated 

Skin history and old routines: I started Differin gel in December and used it until about February, until I ran out. I didn’t really purge, but my skin was flaking a lot at first. I also tried BioClarity during this time. It soothed my skin, but didn’t help my acne. Then at the beginning of April, I was getting more acne. I tried the acnefree severe system and this worked extremely well for me at getting rid of acne,but I could only use it for a few weeks until my skin became super red, peeling, and just felt plain dehydrated. I then decided to get a new prescription for differin. I’ve been using it for a week. And 2 days ago, I bought 2 new moisturizers that have been working for me so far.

Lifestyle changes that have helped: I used to be a big picker, but I’ve noticed that my skin looks so much better when I just let it be. I try not to touch my face as much as possible. Drinking lemon water really helps my skin personally. I change my pillowcase every night and dry my face with a clean towel every time after washing. I also eat vegan and avoid as much refined sugar as possible, as it breaks me out within hours. I consume greens almost everyday, with a smoothie in the morning. I also try not to stress and take baths and read to relax.

Current Routine:
AM: Wash face with Cerave’s Foaming Facial Wash. Moisturize with Cerave’s moisturizing lotion. 

PM: Wash with Cerave’s Foaming Facial Wash. Apply differin. Moisturize with Cerave’s moisturizing cream (in tub).

I also sometimes wash my face after working out in the middle of the day or wash my face after coming home with makeup on.

I’m looking to add a sunscreen for the morning that won’t break me out. I’m also looking into trying some of the ordinary products to help fade my redness scarring. If you guys have any suggestions for products to heal my skin further, please let me know. Thank you so much!💕

Totally safe to layer, neither are actives and there's no negative interaction between them. Just layer from thin >> thick, or whatever works for you :)

> if I use it I ditch the hylauronic acid because I’m not sure how to layer

TO recommends using their water based serums (like Hyaluronic Acid) before their oil based serums (like the Granactive Retinoid.) But honestly, you can layer however you feel is most appropriate. I like to use my oil based retinoids before anything else because I'm pretty stuck in the ""actives must come first!"" mentality, or you could do it how TO recommends, whatever floats your boat! 

>I would alternate the vitamin C but once again unsure on layering.

The 23% vitamin C is a suspension that comes after most of your products. Some people use it before their moisturizer, some people use it after - whatever works for you! I used to apply it first, right after cleansing, let it sit for a while, then I rinsed it off lol. Again, stuck in that ""actives should come first!"" mindset, plus I really hated the gritty texture.

Totally safe to layer, neither are actives and there's no negative interaction between them. Just layer from thin >> thick, or whatever works for you :)

> if I use it I ditch the hylauronic acid because I’m not sure how to layer

TO recommends using their water based serums (like Hyaluronic Acid) before their oil based serums (like the Granactive Retinoid.) But honestly, you can layer however you feel is most appropriate. I like to use my oil based retinoids before anything else because I'm pretty stuck in the ""actives must come first!"" mentality, or you could do it how TO recommends, whatever floats your boat! 

>I would alternate the vitamin C but once again unsure on layering.

The 23% vitamin C is a suspension that comes after most of your products. Some people use it before their moisturizer, some people use it after - whatever works for you! I used to apply it first, right after cleansing, let it sit for a while, then I rinsed it off lol. Again, stuck in that ""actives should come first!"" mindset, plus I really hated the gritty texture.

When you apply it depends on the format it's in - most of the product recs seem to be serums, so you'd apply it after your pH dependent actives with the rest of your moisturizing products (serums, lotions, moisturizers, etc.), thin >> thick.

[B&A] Cheap ass routine and observations in comments!,61,1,0,8idabr,https://i.redd.it/tut9zl80mzw01.jpg,SecretHoSlappa,"Okay, so this is going to be a long one, I'm sorry. The first column of pictures were taken when I was not watching my diet, not drinking enough water, eating way too much shit and using only drugstore, poor quality products that didn't suit my skin. About the same week when I took the pictures, I got my first order from TO (since then I got 3 more) and then it all began. I think it's pointless to mention stuff that didn't work and instead point out the ones that did.

Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% - I am in love with this thing, I got it in every single one of my orders. It helps with texture, it helps with pimples that are already there, it helps with everything. I think it made the biggest difference for me in the very beginning, when it got rid of all the tiny bumps that were visible only when I had makeup on.

Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - another favorite. I loved it in the beginning, then I was stupid enough to stop using it, but now I'm back on it again.  It makes my skin smooth, gets rid of all the tiny dry pieces of skin, it just does the job.

AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - I overused it in the very beginning (2 times a week), now I use it less often (once every 2 weeks or so) and I like it much more. When I feel like my skin is just not the best, when I feel all clogged, I use it.

These are the things that did stand out and made the biggest difference in this year in between first and second column.

Now let's go to the second column. At this point I was upset with my skin still. I was happy to have much less active acne, but I realized I had PIE. Since then I think a change is pretty big and it's just 2 weeks. I changed many things.

First of all, I traveled to Sweden, stayed there for a week. I do it quite often and when I do, my skin always looks better there and goes worse when I come back to Poland. I figured it must be water. Water in Warsaw is an absolute garbage, so I stared using bottled water to wash my face when I'm in Poland.

Another change is a consistent routine. Before I was kind of using the same amount of products all the time, but I was introducing new actives a few at the time, I was never having the same routine day by day and such. Now it's different:



**AM (when I will be going out):**

CeraVe Foaming Cleanser,

Vichy, Ideal Soleil, Emulsion Anti-brillance Toucher Sec SPF 50,

Makeup,

**AM (when I will not be going out):**

CeraVe Foaming Cleanser,

TO Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone (I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I think it is working!),

CeraVe Moisturizer in a tub,


**PM:**

CeraVe Moisturizing Cleanser,

The first column of pictures were taken when I was not watching my diet, not drinking enough water, eating way too much shit and using only drugstore, poor quality products that didn't suit my skin. About the same week when I took the pictures, I got my first order from TO (since then I got 3 more) and then it all began. I think it's pointless to mention stuff that didn't work and instead point out the ones that did.

Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% - I am in love with this thing, I got it in every single one of my orders. It helps with texture, it helps with pimples that are already there, it helps with everything. I think it made the biggest difference for me in the very beginning, when it got rid of all the tiny bumps that were visible only when I had makeup on.

Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - another favorite. I loved it in the beginning, then I was stupid enough to stop using it, but now I'm back on it again.  It makes my skin smooth, gets rid of all the tiny dry pieces of skin, it just does the job.

AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - I overused it in the very beginning (2 times a week), now I use it less often (once every 2 weeks or so) and I like it much more. When I feel like my skin is just not the best, when I feel all clogged, I use it.

These are the things that did stand out and made the biggest difference in this year in between first and second column.

Now let's go to the second column. At this point I was upset with my skin still. I was happy to have much less active acne, but I realized I had PIE. Since then I think a change is pretty big and it's just 2 weeks. I changed many things.

First of all, I traveled to Sweden, stayed there for a week. I do it quite often and when I do, my skin always looks better there and goes worse when I come back to Poland. I figured it must be water. Water in Warsaw is an absolute garbage, so I stared using bottled water to wash my face when I'm in Poland.

Another change is a consistent routine. Before I was kind of using the same amount of products all the time, but I was introducing new actives a few at the time, I was never having the same routine day by day and such. Now it's different:

Makeup,

**AM (when I will not be going out):**

At first it seems like nothing is happening and your skin isn’t taking to anything but keep at it it will subside. I’m going into my fourth week and my texture is still waxy looking, with some clogged pores and a few inflamed pimples but it’s calmed down dramatically over this past month. 

Some things to keep in mind 
1. Don’t pick anything. You may not have a picking issue but I do and it’s been killing me to not pick but even something as benign as taking out a clogged pore (prior to this would of been no big deal) leaves me with more inflamed pimples and red marks. 
2. No exfoliation and no friction. Pat products on, glide cleanser over your face, don’t rub microfiber cloths on your face and don’t oil cleanse. It’s taking me a while to figure all this out but the less touching your face the better. 
3. Sometimes the “holy grail” products just don’t work. Cerave gives me closed comedones and Hyaluronic acid like the Hada Labo toners dry me out. 
4. Hot water/steam exacerbates the problem and dries you out. Use cool water only, and I wouldn’t cleanse in the morning either just use water. Keep your face out of the shower water for now since that’s usually too hot for your face. 

What’s been working for me is pure aloe vera gel I use it alone or mixed with pomegranate seed oil. I also made a toner of glycerin, water and aloe vera. Raw shea butter and if necessary I top it off with Cerave healing ointment. 

I figured my skin is so delicate and sensitive right now the less products with various ingredients the better. That way if I suddenly got a ton of pimples or closed comedones I could figure it out. I’ve added in a couple other things since then and am experimenting with some actual moisturizers because shea butter under makeup isn’t very good. In the beginning though keep it simple. Less is more.

1. Don’t pick anything. You may not have a picking issue but I do and it’s been killing me to not pick but even something as benign as taking out a clogged pore (prior to this would of been no big deal) leaves me with more inflamed pimples and red marks. 
2. No exfoliation and no friction. Pat products on, glide cleanser over your face, don’t rub microfiber cloths on your face and don’t oil cleanse. It’s taking me a while to figure all this out but the less touching your face the better. 
3. Sometimes the “holy grail” products just don’t work. Cerave gives me closed comedones and Hyaluronic acid like the Hada Labo toners dry me out. 
4. Hot water/steam exacerbates the problem and dries you out. Use cool water only, and I wouldn’t cleanse in the morning either just use water. Keep your face out of the shower water for now since that’s usually too hot for your face. 

What’s been working for me is pure aloe vera gel I use it alone or mixed with pomegranate seed oil. I also made a toner of glycerin, water and aloe vera. Raw shea butter and if necessary I top it off with Cerave healing ointment. 

I figured my skin is so delicate and sensitive right now the less products with various ingredients the better. That way if I suddenly got a ton of pimples or closed comedones I could figure it out. I’ve added in a couple other things since then and am experimenting with some actual moisturizers because shea butter under makeup isn’t very good. In the beginning though keep it simple. Less is more.

**New products**: TO Buffet & TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution (I know this shouldn't be used more than 2x/week and absolutely only 1x/week for a couple of months)



**Current AM Routine**

* CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser

*  Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum (about to run out, will be replaced with Timeless 20% Vitamin C + E Ferulic Acid Serum)

* Trader Joe's Facial Cleansing Oil (Will probably not repurchase; works fine but the scent is a bit strong.)

* PC Resist 5% AHA

* 2 layers CosRx Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (Have about 1/3 of the bottle left and am not sure I will repurchase; it hasn't exhibited its purportedly awesome powers on my skin yet.)

* If having an extra dry day, Radha Rosehip Oil

* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream

I already changed my cleanser from Himalaya Facial Wash to Cerave, but the problems persist.

PM: Garnier mircellar water + CeraVe hydrating cleanser + Benefit moisturiser

It really doesn't have to cost a lot to have a good routine. 

All you need, really, is a gentle face wash, moisturiser, and spf. Stick with it for a few months and unless you have other medical problems or allergies, your skin will improve leaps and bounds. There are plenty of recs for starter routines in this sub of you have a look in the side bar. What you are currently using is not meant to go on your face. 

After you've done that, you can refine and tailor your routine to address specific skin concerns. I started on this sub to address my acne and dehydration, and I moved over to r/asianbeauty to focus more on hydrating and tailoring my routine. 

My routine is to help generally moisturise my skin, which is normal but prone to dehydration, fade acne scars, and anti ageing. All prices AUD. I started with the face wash, moisturiser and suncream and added in the other stuff gradually.

Am: rinse with water, melano cc vitamin C serum under eyes and on acne scars ($17, 20ml, lasts foreverrrrr, still have my first tube, has been a year), scinic honey all in one ampoule ($30 for 250ml, lasts like a year), cosrx advanced snail all in one moisturiser ($25ish?, lasts 8 months), cosrx aloe soothing sun cream ($16, 50ml, lasts 4-6months). 

pm: wash with ""hada labo gokujyun foaming cleanser"" (160ml, $14aud, 4-6months amaaazing cleanser), tretinoin prescription, scinic honey all in one ampoule, cosrx moisturiser, and a sleeping pack which is an occlusive layer to help seal everything in for efficient hydration while I'm sleeping (cosrx honey overnight mask, $16 for 60ml, lasts 6 months).

Don't just copy mine, but I'm just  showing you it can be affordable. If repurchase everything when it runs out based on what I wrote above (and using the shortest timeframe e.g. 4 months when products last 4-6mths) I'm spending in total an absolute maximum of $250 a year/less than $5 per week on skincare which really isn't that much considering how much better my skin (and confidence tbh) is for it AND it's not exactly a basic routine which is all you need to start.

I haven’t tried any of those but I will now! 
So I haven’t tried out much but here goes:
Many people on here say alphas 14% AHA is a dupe for it but personally, while it flawlessly cleared up my back acne, it was really irritating and drying on my face. Maybe I have to work my way up to that percentage? It definitely didn’t have the calming + exfoliating + brightening effects DE has. 

The ordinary glycolic toner is just meh to me but has a simple clean ingredient list. This leads me to believe there’s another ingredient/combination of ingredients besides glycolic acid that makes the DE so amazing. 

One product that I can definitely vouch for, though, is the Michael Todd Wild Berry skin peel. It’s not very well known and I tried it on a whim. It’s honestly an amazing product for a third of the price. It might not be a dupe because it’s a mask, but I’ve had similar results with it. It may not be as calming for me though. And the ingredients are somewhat similar! I find it to be a little stronger than the drunk elephant, and I just started tretinoin, so I’m refraining from using it for a bit. I just wanted to find a product that was more of a serum like DE that’s soothing while also exfoliating. 

This mask though I’d definitely recommend  if you’re looking for a DE dupe, that’s a little stronger, and in a little different of a format of application. Good luck and I hope to see your follow up of your list!",6081,tretinoin,ingredients,18

It’s honestly an amazing product for a third of the price. It might not be a dupe because it’s a mask, but I’ve had similar results with it. It may not be as calming for me though. And the ingredients are somewhat similar! I find it to be a little stronger than the drunk elephant, and I just started tretinoin, so I’m refraining from using it for a bit. I just wanted to find a product that was more of a serum like DE that’s soothing while also exfoliating. 

This mask though I’d definitely recommend  if you’re looking for a DE dupe, that’s a little stronger, and in a little different of a format of application. Good luck and I hope to see your follow up of your list!",6081,aha,ingredients,18

[Shelfie] My Current Skincare Routine + mini [review] in the comments!,8,1,0,8idhs3,https://i.redd.it/xn4e0rmwuzw01.jpg,spunkypotato,"As the title reads, this is my current skincare routine! I've found that a simpler routine leads to happier skin, but obviously YMMV still applies. My routine is super budget friendly as I don't really delve into the realm of high-end skincare and all items can easily be found in Australia.

A quick side note: I have normal/oily skin with textural issues.


**Thursday Plantation Rosehip Oil ($16):** This product is HG status for me. From the night I started using it around four months ago, my skin has progressively gotten brighter, softer and plumper and my blemishes and scarring have healed ridiculously fast. I'm talking dark ugly mark to barely there shadow in 2-4 days. I apply three drops on a damp face (one on each cheek and my forehead) and massage the oil in for a few minutes. I find that the water helps the oil 'absorb' better and after a few minutes of rubbing my skin doesn't look greasy at all. HOWEVER, many people seem to break out from rosehip oil so please patch test this before use!


**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% ($10):** This product worked really well initially, but I find that it doesn't work so well anymore. Maybe it's to do with the weather (it is currently freezing here in Australia) but this product hasn't been kind. No matter how I layer other products with it, it leaves a greasy film all over my skin and looks awful. However, a few months ago it worked beautifully and had my skin looking matte all day. I used this in my AM routine after cleansing.


**The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution ($9):** Works quite nicely but results take a while to show, even with regular use. It has, over months, reduced the amount of acne I have and improved skin texture, but at a disappointing rate. Although admittedly, I don't use the product as often. I use this in my PM routine after cleansing.


**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA ($12):** I've been a bit disappointed with this formula. I haven't noticed ANY changes in my skin. I bought this because I heard that it would clear closed comedones on my chin, but it hasn't done squat. The formula is also extremely runny and difficult to apply because it dries so quickly. I use this in my PM routine after cleansing.


**Benzac AC 2.5% Acne Gel ($17):** Another HG status product. This has gotten rid of any textural issues or blemishes much faster than any chemical exfoliants ever have. The difference is noticeable by the next morning. I use this in my PM routine as a spot treatment and it works like a charm every single time. It even gets rid of pesky SFs! My nose has never felt smoother.


**Sudocrem ($9):** Despite being marketed mainly as nappy rash cream, it's actually really good for treating acne due to it's high percentage of zinc oxide. I use this in my PM routine as a spot treatment, mainly for PIH but I also use this as a cover for any blemishes I've extracted, which helps them heal wounds. The topic of acne healing faster with a moist barrier was [posted about recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8gxqi8/research_why_open_wounds_heal_better_when_covered/?st=jh0c0qym&sh=aaf48521). It has helped reduce the appearance of blemishes and PIH.


**Vaseline ($4):** Ah, good old Vaseline. Going full slug face with this results in a glowy, plump complexion by the next morning. Need I say more?


**Essano Rosehip Micellar Water ($12):** I use this in my AM routine to cleanse my skin. I find that I really don't need a proper cleanser in the morning and this does the job well. I use the cotton rounds pictured above with it. It has a low percentage of glycolic acid that somehow managed to clear the intense CCs I had all over my forehead a year ago. 


**Swisse Rosehip Facial Moisturiser ($9):** Works extremely well! I love this moisturiser! I use it AM and PM and it dries down matte and keeps my face nice and happy all day. I find that my face is actually really matte because of how moisturised it is.


**Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel ($12):** I use this in my AM routine on top of my moisturiser. I sweep it across my face and then pat it in. I find that it acts as sort of an occlusive and mattifies my face a bit. It works nicely and is the only aloe vera gel I've found with zero other ingredients or alcohol. 


**Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Clear Face SPF30 Sunscreen ($16):** I really am disappointed with this. It doesn't dry down matte at all and is not sheer. It definitely does the job and keeps my skin protected throughout the day without reapplication, so if you don't mind looking greasy I would give this sunscreen a go. I apply this in my AM routine and after spreading it over my face I will blot to get rid of any greasiness. ",736,niacinamide,ingredients,-2

I use this in my PM routine after cleansing.


**Benzac AC 2.5% Acne Gel ($17):** Another HG status product. This has gotten rid of any textural issues or blemishes much faster than any chemical exfoliants ever have. The difference is noticeable by the next morning. I use this in my PM routine as a spot treatment and it works like a charm every single time. It even gets rid of pesky SFs! My nose has never felt smoother.


**Sudocrem ($9):** Despite being marketed mainly as nappy rash cream, it's actually really good for treating acne due to it's high percentage of zinc oxide. I use this in my PM routine as a spot treatment, mainly for PIH but I also use this as a cover for any blemishes I've extracted, which helps them heal wounds. The topic of acne healing faster with a moist barrier was [posted about recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8gxqi8/research_why_open_wounds_heal_better_when_covered/?st=jh0c0qym&sh=aaf48521). It has helped reduce the appearance of blemishes and PIH.


**Vaseline ($4):** Ah, good old Vaseline. Going full slug face with this results in a glowy, plump complexion by the next morning. Need I say more?


**Essano Rosehip Micellar Water ($12):** I use this in my AM routine to cleanse my skin. I find that I really don't need a proper cleanser in the morning and this does the job well. I use the cotton rounds pictured above with it. It has a low percentage of glycolic acid that somehow managed to clear the intense CCs I had all over my forehead a year ago. 


**Swisse Rosehip Facial Moisturiser ($9):** Works extremely well! I love this moisturiser! I use it AM and PM and it dries down matte and keeps my face nice and happy all day. I find that my face is actually really matte because of how moisturised it is.


**Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel ($12):** I use this in my AM routine on top of my moisturiser. I sweep it across my face and then pat it in. I find that it acts as sort of an occlusive and mattifies my face a bit. It works nicely and is the only aloe vera gel I've found with zero other ingredients or alcohol. 


**Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Clear Face SPF30 Sunscreen ($16):** I really am disappointed with this. It doesn't dry down matte at all and is not sheer. It definitely does the job and keeps my skin protected throughout the day without reapplication, so if you don't mind looking greasy I would give this sunscreen a go. I apply this in my AM routine and after spreading it over my face I will blot to get rid of any greasiness. ",736,rosehip,ingredients,-2
[Shelfie] My Current Skincare Routine + mini [review] in the comments!,8,1,0,8idhs3,https://i.redd.it/xn4e0rmwuzw01.jpg,spunkypotato,"As the title reads, this is my current skincare routine! I've found that a simpler routine leads to happier skin, but obviously YMMV still applies. My routine is super budget friendly as I don't really delve into the realm of high-end skincare and all items can easily be found in Australia.

A quick side note: I have normal/oily skin with textural issues.


**Thursday Plantation Rosehip Oil ($16):** This product is HG status for me. From the night I started using it around four months ago, my skin has progressively gotten brighter, softer and plumper and my blemishes and scarring have healed ridiculously fast. I'm talking dark ugly mark to barely there shadow in 2-4 days. I apply three drops on a damp face (one on each cheek and my forehead) and massage the oil in for a few minutes. I find that the water helps the oil 'absorb' better and after a few minutes of rubbing my skin doesn't look greasy at all. HOWEVER, many people seem to break out from rosehip oil so please patch test this before use!


**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% ($10):** This product worked really well initially, but I find that it doesn't work so well anymore. Maybe it's to do with the weather (it is currently freezing here in Australia) but this product hasn't been kind. No matter how I layer other products with it, it leaves a greasy film all over my skin and looks awful. However, a few months ago it worked beautifully and had my skin looking matte all day. I used this in my AM routine after cleansing.


**The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution ($9):** Works quite nicely but results take a while to show, even with regular use. It has, over months, reduced the amount of acne I have and improved skin texture, but at a disappointing rate. Although admittedly, I don't use the product as often. I use this in my PM routine after cleansing.

Your routine seems like your skin could easily get dried out and irritated. 

1) A good gentle cleanser, that doesn’t have a high pH. My favourite is the “First Aid Beauty Cleanser” (I’m not sure if you can find this in stores in Europe or not). I also really like the su:m 47 rose cleansing stick (probably would have to order online). Cetaphil cleanser is also great... but I personally like the other ones better. 

You mention removing your makeup with tea tree wipes, are these specifically makeup remover wipes? If not, I would switch to micellar water to remove makeup. My personal favourite is made by “Simple” brand. 

2) if your current toner is full of alcohol and dries you out I would stop using it. Thayers witch hazel timers come in alcohol- free formulations and they can help with acne. 

3) if your B.B. cream and Clinique moisture surge are working for you, stick with them for now.

BHA/ AHAs are chemical exfoliants and help remove dead skin so you don’t have to harshly scrub at your skin. 

Azelic acid can be used to brighten skin texture and reduce blemishes. 

Niacinamide is used for brightening and evening skin tone and decreasing oil production.

I just started a routine about a month ago. I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser in the AM. Then I apply my moisturizer. Then the rosehip oil.

At night, I cleanse with the rosehip oil. I take the oil off with a microfiber cloth. Then I use my nighttime moisturizer followed by a few more drops of the rosehip oil.

I'm not shitting you, I saw a massive difference the morning after I used it. Any incoming acne seemed to have… RSVP'D and then bailed. My skin was plumper, smoother, and looked more moisturized.

But I'm working on reparing a very damaged moisture barrier. I still get oily, I still get pimples, but I get oily later in the day, and my pimples heal much faster. I also feel my nasolabial lines are softened. 

So while I haven't tried the other brand, I won't. I love this one. I have huge pores, SFs, CCs, cystic acne and scarring. All of that shit has gotten better for me. I love it.

I just bought hyaluronic acid. But I'm scared to use it because things are going so well. 

Anyway, just my experience. Yours could differ, but absolutely that oil is what made me feel OK about leaving my house without slathering foundation on my face. For the first time since I was twelve. I'm 32.

Advice and recommendations?",2,3,1,8icnlv,https://i.redd.it/0v1jrinnwyw01.jpg,tangerincdream,"Now this is the worse side of my face, but it really captures my overall problem best. Ton of acne marks, very uneven skin tone all over, dark under eyes and discoloration around the nose. 

I’m super bummed because my skin is really smooth finally, but the overall look is still very... splotchy and meh. I wake up in the morning and even though my skin feels 10x better it just does not look better, actually I look almost more tired. 

[This] (https://imgur.com/a/iEd88Uq) is what my skin looked like in the beginning of February, so it *has* improved, but it stills brings me really down. I don’t wear foundation much because I just don’t like the look of it on my skin, but the area is just too big for pinpoint concealing :(

Because I’m on epiduo I can’t use acids, and aside from the discoloration I don’t feel the need to, because the adapalene in epiduo really leaves no room for other exfoliation. 

My skin type is combo to normal, if I get oily I tend to get oily in my T-Zone, so middle of the forehead, around the nostrils and on my chin. Without epiduo I struggle with pretty dehydrated and therefore flaky (but not tight) skin.

My routine:

AM
* wash briefly with water
* moisturize with Sebamed Creme (like the classic original one with 2% vitamin e)
* sunscreen, make p:rem UV defense me natural sun cream (hated this at first but I might repurchase this instead of trying the biore)

PM
* take off makeup with garnier micellar water, was using banila clean it Zero for sensitive skin before that 
* wash with neutrogena hydrating facial wash (I actually love this, I tried other gentle washes, but I keep coming back to this one)
* Epiduo gel, then I wait for a minimum of 20 minutes, it usually borders more on 40 minutes to an hour though.
* Sebamed Creme


I’d love any and all advice or product recommendations to even out my skin tone!

Boy did I hit the skin lottery lol. 

The biggest thing that’s helped for me is keeping my routine minimal and not overwhelming my skin with too many products. Foaming cleansers are a big no. I used to use Sebamed Facial cleansing foam with absolutely no problems for about 4 years before my skin decided its had enough and caused the biggest rosacea flare up ever. It’s taken me months to calm my skin down. So if you suspect you have rosacea definitely go with the mildest cleansers and products with straightforward ingredients. 

SPF is the most important. I can tolerate combination sunscreens but if you can find a physical sunscreen then that would be ideal. 

My dermatologist prescribed Metrogyl for the redness and it definitely helps. I use it at night and whenever I wake up I find that my skin has zero redness. But even something as simple as cleansing my face using my fingers tends to bring the redness back. 

My current routine 

AM

*Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 
*Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream 
*Innisfree perfect UV protection cream Triple care SPF 50 PA +++

PM

*Kose speedy cleansing oil (If you’re using a cleansing oil, do not massage it for more than a minute. I went overboard once because it felt so good and my skin was super sensitive and kinda hurt after I washed it off)
*Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 
*Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream 
*Metrogyl 

I spot treat any pimples I have with *clindamycin and it usually goes on after the metrogyl. 

Things that didn’t work out for me:

*Cosrx Low Ph Good Morning Gel Cleanser - Found it too drying for my skin although it did not make my rosacea worse. 

*Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence - My first foray into trying a chemical sunscreen and I loved the consistency and how easily it went on. But it gave me the worst breakout I’ve had in years. Still bummed about that. Again, it did not make my rosacea worse even though it has extremely high alcohol content. But then again I did only use it for a couple of times. 

*Sebamed Clear face gel - I’m so bummed my skin reacted badly to this. I’m not sure if it was because of the product itself or if my skin was just going through a bad phase. Will give it another try once my skin clams down.

*Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence - Definitely helped me get rid of some stubborn dry patches I had on the sides of my face but it also broke me out in tiny pustules around my mouth. Since then I’ve realized Niacinamide breaks me out. 

*La Roche Posay Lipkar Baume AP+ - Skin went crazy after this!! I suspect it was all the Niacinamide again. I also found the consistency to be too thick. 

*Cosrx ultra moisturizing lotion with birch sap - On the fence about this one. Absorbs very easily but leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky. ",124,niacinamide,ingredients,-7

The dermatologists I’ve spoken to seem to have two criteria: they recommend products or ingredients that have independent research behind them (eg, retinoids, vitamin c, some acids), and they see a lot of irritation from product overload that they have to help heal. So the general line from them is to keep things simple and just use proven stuff. 
A lot of skincare brands seem to be advocating a ‘more is better’, ‘stronger is better’ , layer 100 products kind of approach. Plus they hype ingredients that have no evidence, which I call the Himalayan Butterfly wings approach.

I’m a white guy in my early 30s, some Mediterranean background so I naturally have slightly darker skin, which has made treatment options tricky. I haven’t used Retin-A cream since high school/college and my dermatologist hasn’t recommended it yet. Although I have an appointment coming up, I’ll definitely ask about it.

Sorry to hear that your experience hasn’t been as good as you expected, have you talked with other dermatologists to get second opinions? I was also told that with subsequent laser treatments there’s a “diminishing return” aspect, which is why I’m considering the microneedling procedures.

Clindamycin didn't help much but the oral antibiotics that I took for a month mostly cleared up my face. About 3 months ago (early March) my face started breaking out again, I went to my dermatologist(the same guy) and he prescribed me oral and solution antibiotics. (Erithromycin 2% Sol Perr & SMZ/TMP DS 800-160M). Today was the last day on the oral antibiotics and they haven't helped at all. I want to pay him a visit again but I don't want to take anymore antibiotics. During this time, I found SSS blog about fungal acne and I was sure I had it. I started cleansing with VaniCream, tried some Stridex (only for 2 weeks because it's was too irritating) and used Benton Propolis as moisturizer. 

Skin Type: Oily, Acne Prone, Sensitive

Current Routine:
AM
-rinse with water
-BENTON Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel with Squalane 100% PureOil
-Biore UV Suncreen (pink bottle)

Evening:
-Vanicream for Sensitive Skin
-Squalane 100% Pure Oil

I sometimes do a mask with raw manuka honey in the evening. 
I want to introduce actives but I am a little scared to how my face will react. 

How Long: I have been using this routine for about a month. I incorporated squalane oil two weeks ago, before it was just benton aloe propolis gel. 

Anything new: For a period of time, I was using Lotrimin on my skin because I thought I had fungal acne. I really don't know what is going on with my skin now. I think it helped my forehead CCs a little but I ran out of it.

Location: US

The real issue here is that I have these red bumps on my cheeks, sometimes they have whiteheads but they are just always there. My chin is always red, there are pimples and just red marks.

Hopefully this thread is the appropriate place. Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

**The issue:** There's a couple.  [The first is the skin on my upper chest, traps, and shoulders](https://imgur.com/CIsF7eR).  I'm not sure if this is keratosis pillaris.  Hopefully it is not, as the stuff on this sub indicates that you can't really eliminate it.  For this issue specifically, I've been moisturizing more than I used to since some threads here suggested that for keratosis pillaris, but I haven't seen any noticeable results from this.  
 
The second thing is on my [stomach](https://imgur.com/fpAHeUF) and [lower back](https://imgur.com/SboZLKp).  I think that it is just acne, but I've been dealing with acne for about 9 years (since grade 8) and all that's happened is that the bad acne on my chest has moved down.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with this beyond what I am currently doing? 

The last is (sorry) my inner thigh [(NSFW-ish warning)](https://imgur.com/UJS6lkt). I'd like an opinion or two if it is Acanthosis Nigricans or not.  For this issue, I've cut out most sugary foods, and I'm cutting weight.  

**Skin type:** I think my skin is oily on my face, but everywhere else is a bit dry.  

**Current routine:** In the morning, I wash my face, moisturize, and use sunscreen on my face.  At night, I wash my face with just water, then my body and face with Neutrogena salicylic acid acne treatment for the body and face (2%).  Then I moisturize.  

**How long:** I've been doing this exactly for about 1 month.  But I've been doing basically this for a year or two. 

**Anything new:** I've cut out most dairy (except for some whey), cut out most sugar, and have been losing some weight recently.  But I think these things should only improve skin health. 

**Location:** Southeast USA.

A few weeks ago I started using the COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, and experienced some stinging/tingling and flushing when using the product. The product unfortunately ended up causing cysts on my chin and forehead (which I usually don't get - especially not ouside of my period), so I stopped using it a few days ago.

I'm trying to figure out which ingredient was the culprit, and made an excel-sheet to cross-check the ingredients. 

(The ingredients are: Salix Alba (Willow Bark Water), Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol)

I'm pretty sure it's not Butylene Glycol, Arginine, Sodium Hyaluronate or Xanthan Gum, since I've used other products with these ingredients, that didn't cause any reaction. I'm also quite convinced that the flushing/tingling I experienced was due to the niacinamide, since that seems to be a common occurence when using the ingredient? Generally, I /think/ the culprit might be the niacinamide, but I don't know if it's common for that ingredient to cause breakouts/cystic acne? I also considered whether the Betaine Salicylate might be responsible, but I've tried products with low concentrations of Salicylic Acid before, and since it works kinda like the Betaine Salicylate (afaik?), that might be enough to rule it out?
 
Any input or experiences with the aforementioned ingredients (especially niacinamide!) would be greatly appreciated, since I don't want to make the mistake of buying other products with an ingredient, that breaks me out. Thank you in advance! :)",4,salicylic acid,ingredients,-5

You could then layer marula oil \(oils are occlusive\) or Clinque on top of that to seal the hydration in, if you feel you needed more.

My journey has been a total nightmare, with my skin like this for years whilst my doctor in the UK repeatedly tried me on various antibiotics which not only didn’t work, but also gave me horrible side effects and made me really sick. 


I was repeatedly put on the combined pill then taken off again by a different doctors due to my migraines (I get them without aura and the general consensus seems to be that the benefit outweighs the risk, but each doctor had their own opinions). I was on it when the acne started, and was never on it for more than a few months whilst it was at its worst.


My doctor, this entire time, refused to refer me to a dermatologist because I didn’t want to go on accutane. She said dermatologist is a last resort for if accutane doesn’t work. 


In the end, I moved to Spain. A country where I can buy the pill over the counter. I went on Yasmine when I moved 7 months ago and you can see the results. 


I think the fact I stopped using concealer and started only using Garnier’s BB cream on my skin also made a massive difference.


I don’t have a routine, really:


Morning:

- Clinique anti-blemish toner (I don’t really like this product, it dries me out too much and has too much alcohol, but I dont know of a better one)
- Garnier 5-1 BB cream (and rest of make up)

Evening:

- Remove make up with whichever tea tree wipes I have at the time
- If I remember: Wash with tea tree foaming wash (am looking for suggestions here)
- Moisturise with Clinique Moisture Surge Intense
- Yasmine combined pill

I tried snail mucin, but it caused bumps to appear in the areas I struggle with blackheads.


I am looking for advice on how to improve my skin further and optimise my routine. 

If you have any suggestions for me as replacements or additions, I’d be super grateful!

I've been stalking this sub for at least a year and I've started to finally *care* so I'm trying to tackle my biggest issues. I don't know what any of you are talking about 99% of the time though, so I need some real ELI5 help.

**Here's my background on acne:** I'm 26 female living in North Carolina. I've had acne and bad skin since I was about 11. Over time my acne has started to clear up but it's not perfect. I still get acne along my jaw line mostly. Occasionally I'll get them on my chin. My nose and cheek very occasionally and I pretty much never get acne on my forehead. I'm not sure what kind of acne, but it seems very normal. Just a few pimples lining my jawline, and the occasional bigger ones in the places I mentioned.

**Possible rosacea problems:** My face has ALWAYS been red, but it's mostly just my cheeks now. I'm pretty sure some of the redness is from rosacea, but I also have red skin so maybe I just have rosy cheeks. Hard to tell, it's always been this way. But I think it's redder than necessary. 

**Skin Type:** I think I have combination type skin. My cheeks feel very normal, not oily or dry. My chin gets dry most out of everything and can also be really oily at different times, but my forehead is mostly always oily. It's overall been better since I've been taking care of my skin though.

**HELP MY SUN SPOTS:** My BIGGEST complaint that I'm really looking for advice on is my sun spots. I grew up sailing so I've unfortunately burnt my face many times. About three years ago I developed a MAJOR sun spot on my forehead. It covers majority of it in a giant circleish. I also have two half moon sun spots under both eyes. They have all faded since they first appeared, but my skin's complexion and tone is my biggest complaint. From the sun spots, to the redness, and bad texture/coloring from acne scarring (I think), my face would look a million times better if it was one color.

My skin is also *sensitive*. I'm allergic to fragrance so I hesitate to put new things on my skin.

**ROUTINE: So here's what I've been doing, which isn't much:**

**AM:**

- Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser.

- Cerave Hydrating Micellar water (not sure what this does but it makes my face look so much more hydrated and my face hasn't been oily or dry)

- Cerave Moisturizing Cream.

- If I leave the house I put on sunscreen, which is just a generic one. But I work from home so I don't leave much. 

**PM:**

Same as above, except I add in Differin if my acne is bad. 

I also occasionally use Thayer's witch hazel but I'm not sure if that has any effect. 

Pretty much I've transitioned from harsh exfoliating products to these above products and my skin is happier already. My pores appear smaller after the foaming scrub, and the micellar water seems to be helping with hydration. I also like the moisturizer. I used Belif's true cream moisturizing bomb before I ran out and loved it, but it's expensive. 

I'm really looking for a toner (I think?) or something that will even out the tone/complexion of my skin as well as the texture, hopefully. 

Can anyone recommend anything for massive sunspots and bad complexion?",2416,differin,products,-6

About three years ago I developed a MAJOR sun spot on my forehead. It covers majority of it in a giant circleish. I also have two half moon sun spots under both eyes. They have all faded since they first appeared, but my skin's complexion and tone is my biggest complaint. From the sun spots, to the redness, and bad texture/coloring from acne scarring (I think), my face would look a million times better if it was one color.

My skin is also *sensitive*. I'm allergic to fragrance so I hesitate to put new things on my skin.

**ROUTINE: So here's what I've been doing, which isn't much:**

**AM:**

- Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser.

- Cerave Hydrating Micellar water (not sure what this does but it makes my face look so much more hydrated and my face hasn't been oily or dry)

- Cerave Moisturizing Cream.

- If I leave the house I put on sunscreen, which is just a generic one. But I work from home so I don't leave much. 

**PM:**

Same as above, except I add in Differin if my acne is bad. 

I also occasionally use Thayer's witch hazel but I'm not sure if that has any effect. 

Pretty much I've transitioned from harsh exfoliating products to these above products and my skin is happier already. My pores appear smaller after the foaming scrub, and the micellar water seems to be helping with hydration. I also like the moisturizer. I used Belif's true cream moisturizing bomb before I ran out and loved it, but it's expensive. 

I'm really looking for a toner (I think?) or something that will even out the tone/complexion of my skin as well as the texture, hopefully. 

Can anyone recommend anything for massive sunspots and bad complexion?",2416,cerave moisturizing cream,products,-6

I’m trying to treat some leftover post acne pigmentation and I was really excited about introducing Vitamin C in my routine, so I started using it every night. After a couple days, I started getting some very small bumps that don’t come to a head on my forehead. As soon as I stopped the Vit C, they disappeared.

Is this because I used it too often from the start? Can Vit C do this? I haven’t used it before, so maybe it was just too much at once for my skin.

Also, I have dehydrated combo skin and get the occasional hormonal breakout, but nothing major.

[Routine Help] 20% azelaic acid or BHA?,5,3,0,8hihd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hihd3/routine_help_20_azelaic_acid_or_bha/,uandurcronies,"We have similar skin! This has honestly been my struggle because I’m not too sure if it’s closed comedones, weird texture due to use of retin-a and sun damage from teen years, or it’s hormonal at this point. 

But I’m determined to keep it simple. After cleansing, I usually apply Melazepam. Now I’m using a BHA every couple of nights, depending on how my forehead looks (the rest of my face receives different treatment because it’s much smoother looking). My forehead doesn’t have any breakouts right now *knocks on wood* and the gritty/big pores texture looks much more reduced. It’s really most noticeable to me in those magnified mirrors under bright lights. 

I suspect azelaic acid has helped the most, but a BHA can also help out. The melazepam doesn’t bother me at all so I feel ok using it nightly; stridex a few times a week because I don’t want to overexfoliate like I used to lol. 

For my forehead moisturizer: I stick to light layers of Hada Labo lotion (hydrating toner - the green one). Previously I was just using aloe vera gel. Now, I sometimes use Cetaphil hydrating lotion because it has urea and I think that ingredient might help with the texture also. 

My forehead texture isn’t completely what I’d like it to be (I’m always wishing for that smooth/poreless forehead look lol), but it’s better than it’s been in a while. I’m going to keep at a minimalist routine with emphasis on azelaic acid and BHA - I may use an AHA later on if I feel things aren’t improving. I also want to keep trying out urea and see if it helps. Other than that, I think it’s important to use light hydrating layers of your product of choice. I don’t think my forehead likes heavier gels and creams, as they will likely clog my pores.

Not sure if I should incorporate a new product like a lactic or glycolic acid toner into my routine just for lightening, or increase my tretinoin percentage. I've been at 0.05% for about 3 years now. I'm also just unsure of what other products I can combine with the tretinoin. I feel like I've hit a plateau. 

* Is there ANY setting powder that doesn't have mica, silica, or talc in it? All three of them break me out, but I'd like something other than blotting papers to sop up my oil now that summer is approaching.

[Skin Concerns] The Rosacea HG Thread: Share your skincare secrets! (Week 10),77,1,1,8hksvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8hksvt/skin_concerns_the_rosacea_hg_thread_share_your/,ViolaineSugarHiccup,"If you suspect you have rosacea, the best thing you can do is visit a dermatologist. There are other skin conditions that present similar to rosacea subtype I or subtype II so self diagnosing and self treatment are not the best ideas. Rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that worsens with age if left untreated. Rosacea also means constant management to prevent flare ups. I am very fortunate to have a great dermatologist. I haven't had a serious flare up in years and most of the credit goes to his treatment approach.

When you read things about rosacea treatment keep in mind that most of the time people are talking about subtype II, the one that presents with papules, pustules, and can be confused with acne, or a combination of subtype I and II. Treatment for subtype I (transient or pertistant erythema) differs from treatment for subtype II and often things recommended for subtype II do not work well for subtype I. In general managing subtype I is more complicated and often requires the utilization of IPL or PDL treatments. Treatment can also be an individual thing as rosacean skin is usually the most sensitive and reactive skin out there. For example, a lot of people (myself included) respond very well to azelaic acid but it can be too irritating for others. Always keep in mind that all medications come with potential 
side effects. A good rule of thumb is if it makes you more red it ain't good. You want to calm your skin and not irritate it and possibly trigger more inflammation. 

Next to medication, managing your triggers to prevent or minimize flare ups is important. Triggers vary by the individual but the most common ones include sun exposure, central heating and/or AC, alcohol, essential oils, stress, working out, spicy food, certain skin care products (mostly actives, astringents like witch hazel, high content in denatured alcohol, physical or chemical exfoliation).

Even if you can tolerate some of the ingredients I mentioned above for now, it is usually recommended to avoid them or at least not use them until your skin has been flare up free for a prolonged period and only after checking with your treating dermatologist. Always keep in mind that your skin is very reaction prone and it is best to baby it as much as possible. Recommended products are usually fragrance and essential oil free and come with soothing ingredients like niacinamide, oat, green tea, ceramides, centella, or licorice root. Many french pharmacy brands have lines for extra sensitive skin or special lines for rosacea. CeraVe also seems to work well for a lot of people as do certain Asian Beauty brands or lines. Etude House has a very nice range called Soon Jung, many Hada Labo products are well tolerated as is the Meishoku CeraColla range.

The most important product next to any medication is sunscreen. Most dermatologists recommend inorganic filters since those tend to not cause reactions. However, zinc oxide can be drying for some people so the newer generation of organic filters available in most Asian countries and the EU can be a good alternative. I use sunscreens with Tinosorbs or Meroxyls as the main filters and do so much better with them.",77,niacinamide,ingredients,-2

I was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer in December things are looking better since i started chemo in January with my health overall. My main problem is now because of most likely the chemo and a different medication called dexamethasone or decadron( a steroid) i had to take i have a lot of acne scarring- dark spots and SEVERE dry skin. I shower in lukewarm water for no more than 10 minutes generally i use a very mild soap as fragrances have become very irritating to my skin and as soon as i get out of the shower i pile on coconut oil all over my body within 20 -30 minutes though my skin is rough scaly dry and severely itchy again. I am not getting too much acne anymore as they weaned me of the steroid that was causing the acne flare ups. My main need for help is a super duper strong long lasting lotion or oil because I'm quite miserable right now as my skin just flakes off and is so itchy it makes it almost impossible to sleep and if you also have a recommendation for something to use to get rid of dark spots. I use cetaphil facial cleanser and st ives green tea for blackheads and st ives facial scrub the oatmeal one i think. Please if you know of any product please help me ive asked my doctor and he just keeps recommending this menthol based ltion to stop the itching but it hardly works ...please help :(,3731,cetaphil,products,-9

Being a very sporty person i generally spend quite some time in the sun (30 degrees celcius on average here) and having a stressful academic life doesnt improve things.

I figured out i have oily skin and after showering it doesn’t take long for me to have some oil on my face already. This coupled with the fact that I sweat pretty easily means my skin gets pretty oily throughout the day.

My previous routine for the past 3-4 months has been me washing once in the morning and once in the evening with Innisfree Jeju Pore Cleansing foam.
While applying Dalacin- T at night on my acne and A derma Severe blemish care cream on areas with spots. With the Innisfree volcanic clay mask twice a week. Recently i changed my cleanser to Premier- Sof Ac-Klear premium cleansing foam at ph5.5.

My problem is that while i get acne quite often the problematic ones are the big zits that i tend to pop and scratch at haha

Also dalacin T makes my skin somewhat dry if i use it too much, but if i do not use it my skin becomes oily again.

Most of my acne appears on my cheeks and my upper lip area and between my brows.

One thing i’ll admit is that i take quite a lot of dairy products, around 300ml of milk a day. I think i should cut down on that and I also hate my greens which i’m trying to work on

I’m looking for advice on whether i’m using suitable products in my current routine, and any changes need to be made. I’m also looking for advice on my dalacin T usage (which i found to have both pros and cons). And lastly any recommendations be it with products to clear up my blemishes or other changes to my diet.

The past few months I've gotten into the routine of wash (Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser), serum (The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%), moisturizer (Clinique/Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel).

I do this same routine at morning and at night. I really like how the products are working for me. My first question is if I should do the same routine for the morning and for the evening? I notice how quickly my The Ordinary serum goes and I'd like to make it last a bit longer (I wish the bottles were bigger!) I'm thinking about switching out either the morning or evening for Thayer's witch hazel toner. Any suggestions on this?

Now for spot treatment. I generally am happy with how my routine has helped my skin but I really need to find a spot treatment that works for me. I have oily/combination skin and get about 1 breakout spot each week. Any suggestions on a good spot treatment?

Clinique All About Eyes. I know eye cream isn't necessary but I can't stay away from this one, it just feels so good.

Lush Tea Tree Toner spray. Makes a great freshen-up spritz and I'm a sucker for tea tree oil.

Superdrug Naturally Radiant Glycolic Overnight Peel. I use it 3-4 nights in a row once a month or so and it really smooths and softens my skin as well as brightening it up.

I also realized my skin care routine was weak so decided to amp it up (I was literally just washing makeup off and applying perscription retinol, then moisturizer). My routine is similar to yours but I'm wondering, should the trentinoin / retinol be applied before toning, or after?

I have food related eczema issues. The dryness and sensitivity is currently in overdrive due to pregnancy. I live in Canada

Current routine:

**AM:**

- *Cleanse*: quick rinse with baby washcloth and warm water

- *Moisturize+spf*: Cetaphil daily spf 15 in fall/winter and spf 50 in spring/summer 

**PM:**

- *Cleanse*: CeraVe facial bar soap (looking to change this as well)

- *Exfoliate*: I'm pushing 30 and considering adding a chemical exfoliant once I'm no longer pregnant/breastfeeding unless there are some safe ones that I don't know about?

- *Moisturizing*: old school Nivea creme in the blue tin. I'm not loving this anymore though. I don't like the way it tugs on my skin when I'm applying it. Open to suggestions.

**Occasional**

- Bio-oil. I use this on my belly (so itchy) with Aveeno body lotion on top and occasionally I'll use the bio oil on my neck and around my eyes and lips if they are feeling particularly dry

I'm looking for a new gentle cleanser for the evening and a daily sunscreen/block recommendation for the summer months. I'm thinking about trying Avene or LaRochePosay for cleansers. For a daily moisturizer+spf, in the winter I was using Cetaphil daily moisturizer spf 15 (northern latitude sahm who hibernates in the cold). But then I caught the pregnant again and now it burns so bad for like 2 days, I'm not willing to try the 50 for the summer, as that was a bit tingly as well when I'm not pregnant. I'm looking for a facial sunscreen/block I can use daily, preferably in a spf 50 for the summer, as we spend most of the day outdoors. My skin is crazy dry and sensitive and I'm not due until September so this isn't going away. I've use Alba botanical sunblock in the past and it burned quite a bit as well. I find the Aveeno baby sunstick works okay (doesn't burn for 2 days), but it is not ideal for daily use, more like a beach/pool day type product.",5541,cetaphil,products,4

Most people don't need astringent toners in their routine, and drying out your skin can absolutely make acne and texture problems worse. 

I would look for a gentle cleanser ro use twice a day. The CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser is what I use and love, highly recommended on this sub, although it doesn't work for everyone (usually because of the fatty alcohols, and I believe it's hard to get in Europe :/ )

You could try using your moisturizer in the morning too! Just wait for it to sink in for a few minutes before putting your BB cream on.

Sunscreen would also be a great addition to your routine! Even if the Garnier BB has SPF in it, if you used enough to get proper protection, your face would look like a cakey mess.

Also, if you have the money for it, I HIGHLY recommend Dermalogica’s Calm Water Gel.

Goodbye weekly fake tans, hello no makeup Monday!",770,1,1,8hsl6h,https://i.imgur.com/Alzp2ZU.png,zylophone,"In the first photo from 2008, I was in the middle of a Lindsay Lohan-esque phase that involved constant tanning booths and fake tan lotion.  I looked orange most of the time, but I decided that was the way I liked it.  I used apricot scrub (ack!) 1x a day and slathered on foundation that was darker than my actual skin tone.  Bad news all around.


About 4 or 5 years ago I stumbled across this sub and decided to uproot my skin routine.  I was tired of needing so much foundation despite being under 30.  After some trial and error, here's what my routine looks like now:


MORNING

* Oil cleanse with [The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Water-Bright-Cleansing-Korean-Beauty/dp/B00PKWYJGY).  Rinse off in the shower.
* Moisturize with Cerave in the tub
* Elta MD 45 Sunscreen

NIGHT

* Oil cleanse again to remove makeup
* Cerave foaming facial cleanser
* Tone with Thayer's Witch Hazel Aloe Vera toner
* Lightly apply Paula's Choice 2% BHA with hands (I'm lazy)
* Wait ~10 min to dry, then apply Cerave in the tub

My routine ended up being fairly simple, I'm lucky to not have significant challenges with acne, but my pores are still pretty large (the BHA definitely helps).  Being able to go to work without makeup on is definitely a milestone for me, so thank you SCA!

Goodbye weekly fake tans, hello no makeup Monday!",770,1,1,8hsl6h,https://i.imgur.com/Alzp2ZU.png,zylophone,"In the first photo from 2008, I was in the middle of a Lindsay Lohan-esque phase that involved constant tanning booths and fake tan lotion.  I looked orange most of the time, but I decided that was the way I liked it.  I used apricot scrub (ack!) 1x a day and slathered on foundation that was darker than my actual skin tone.  Bad news all around.


About 4 or 5 years ago I stumbled across this sub and decided to uproot my skin routine.  I was tired of needing so much foundation despite being under 30.  After some trial and error, here's what my routine looks like now:


MORNING

* Oil cleanse with [The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Water-Bright-Cleansing-Korean-Beauty/dp/B00PKWYJGY).  Rinse off in the shower.
* Moisturize with Cerave in the tub
* Elta MD 45 Sunscreen

NIGHT

* Oil cleanse again to remove makeup
* Cerave foaming facial cleanser
* Tone with Thayer's Witch Hazel Aloe Vera toner
* Lightly apply Paula's Choice 2% BHA with hands (I'm lazy)
* Wait ~10 min to dry, then apply Cerave in the tub
