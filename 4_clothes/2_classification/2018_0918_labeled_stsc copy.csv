Getting the black color. Which one would you consider more stylish? Durable? Warm?

Which of these jackets would look less bulky? Does one have a better functioning hood compared to the other?

Read all of the reviews for both jackets, but still undecided. Leaning toward The North Face because it appears to have a slimmer fit, although I hear the elastic band around the waist isn't as practical as the drawstring on the Patagonia jacket, which allows you to tighten the jacket around the waist with more precision.

I'd be happy with either, but input is definitely appreciated.

Reviews are actually pretty good and the shoes look decent enough.  

I know this sub hates Cole Haan in general, but I really like the sole on these zerogrand shoes.  I actually have a lunar grand cap toe which is good 5+ years old and it's still in great condition.

&#x200B;

I missed out that Lord and Taylor Cole Haan sale from labor day and that looks like a pricing error which I don't expect to happen anytime soon.  Zerogrands are too expensive and I rather pay less than $100 or less for them.

So back to these Laok shoes... Do you guys think these are decent frugal alternatives or should I just wait for some kind of sales from Cole Haan?
